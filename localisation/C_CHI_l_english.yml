 ### Economic Events
 DH_CHI_Economy.1.t:0 "Rising Silver Prices Cripple the Yuan"
 DH_CHI_Economy.1.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]It seemed that our country was going to avoid the effects of the Depression, even experiencing a boom in exports while the rest of the world was suffering from deflation.\n\n We were wrong. \n\nSince the first years of the Republic of China, our silver reserves establishes the value of our currency. However, countries around the globe are starting to depreciate their currencies and the price of silver is starting to rise as a result. This is causing a severe deflation that is negatively affecting the value of the Chinese yuan on the foreign exchange markets, that has no sign of stopping any time soon."
 DH_CHI_Economy.1.a:0 "This is not looking good"

 DH_CHI_Economy.2.t:0 "The Depression Worsens"
 DH_CHI_Economy.2.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Our current financial crisis has just gotten worse. \n\nAs part of their new interventionist policies, the United States government has recently begun buying greats amounts of silver to infalte the prices of the metal. This is causing silver to flow from the interior of China to the financial center of Shanghai where is exported to the United States, causing a catastrophic price deflation that is greatly affecting our agriculture and our industry. As the financial crisis worsens, China's economic future remains uncertain."
 DH_CHI_Economy.2.a:0 "Damn you, Yanks!"

 DH_CHI_Economy.3.t:0 "United States Silver Purchase Act"
 DH_CHI_Economy.3.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Another blow to our economy. \n\nContinuing their policies of purchasing silver in great amounts, the United States Government passed the Silver Purchase Act that facilitates the purchase of silver abroad until the world price of silver rises above $1.29 per ounce. While this legislation was probably made just to support American silver producers, this has unintended consequences for us. With the price of silver jumping rapidly worldwide, silver is flowing out of China even faster. Not only deflation is skyrocketing, but our own exports are shrinking. The banks are withdrawing notes out of circulation after selling their silver abroad, and the lack of supply of bank notes caused the prices to fall affecting many businesses and their workers in the process. Since we have to relay on more loans, our debt policy is becoming even more of a burden. We need to do something about the silver efflux, specially the private banks responsible for this problem."
 DH_CHI_Economy.3.a:0 "We are the meal and they are the carving knife"

 DH_CHI_Economy.4.t:0 "Controls Placed on Silver Exchange"
 DH_CHI_Economy.4.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon] We need to stop the uncontrolled deflation that is wreaking havoc in our economy  at all costs. That's why we decided to impose controls on the foreign exchange of silver to put an end to the efflux of the metal. This would consist on a duty of 10 percent and an equalization charge, with both being adjusted daily,  that have the aim of making the export of silver unprofitable. Since the forces behind the rise of the price of silver have no interest in stopping their operations, we need to take matter into our own hands to protect the economic welfare of the people of China."
 DH_CHI_Economy.4.a:0 "Let's see if it works"

 DH_CHI_Economy.5.t:0 "The Depression Begins to Improve!"
 DH_CHI_Economy.5.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon] Our measures to combat deflation are bearing some fruits. Since we imposed duty and equalization charges on the silver market, silver exports have fallen off dramatically. However, selling silver remains a profitable activity, so we had to sell foreign currency to stabilize our own. Some high-ranking government officials suggested that the silver-standard makes the effects price fluctuations unavoidable, and we should abandon it in favor a foreign-based currency. Our government is caught in the dilemma of preserving silver or preserving foreign currencies. It looks like more structural changes will be necessary to put the economy back on track."
 DH_CHI_Economy.5.a:0 "Finally some good news"

 DH_CHI_Economy.6.t:0 "Chiang Kai-Shek Speaks against bankers"
 DH_CHI_Economy.6.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon] While our government struggles to solve this crisis, the private banks are trying to cut ties with us. The largest private bank of the country, the Bank of China, is attempting to liquidate our bonds, which could make us unable to continue financing through debts.  In return, Chiang Kai-Shek and the new finance minister, H H Kung, are blaming the banks for the economic crisis, accusing them of seeking profit above the interests of the public. The newspapers are supporting these claims, with angry citizens voicing their discontent with the greedy banks. This shift in public opinion thanks to this effective  propaganda campaign allowed us to convince the private banks to provide emergency funds for businesses affected by the deflation. But we need to go further if we want to end this crisis."
 DH_CHI_Economy.6.a:0 "This is their fault"

 DH_CHI_Economy.7.t:0 "The Banking Coup"
 DH_CHI_Economy.7.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon] The era of unscrupulous bankers ruining the economy with their greed is over. Today, Minister Kung has announced the nationalization of two major private banks in China: the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. This takeover was possible by holding enough shares in both banks, with the government effectively becoming the majority stockholder. Some argue that the emergency funds used to buy the shares could have been used to aid the business affected by the crisis, but it was a necessary sacrifice to stop the deflation. More patriotic appointees willing to serve the country instead of themselves will replace the old bankers that have caused this mess in the first place. Since we now are in control the two biggest banks in China, we’ll be able to take control of the remaining private banks in the future by hoarding their banknotes."
 DH_CHI_Economy.7.a:0 "We are the banks now!"

 DH_CHI_Economy.8.t:0 "Fabi Currency Introduced"
 DH_CHI_Economy.8.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon] The prospect of a total financial catastrophe makes it necessary to enact an ambitious monetary and banking reform. To finally end our long-time dependence on silver reserves, the government will issue a new currency detached from the silver standard: the Fabi. The new banknotes are full legal tender to use in public and private transactions and the payment of taxes. Chinese citizens and other private institutions are required to hand over their remaining silver reserves to the newly formed Currency Reserve Board to use the new currency, which we'll use for our debts with the United States. The process of distribution of the Fabi banknotes is going to be handled gradually and carefully to avoid inflation, with banknotes issued by other banks allowed to circulate in amounts fixed by the government, but eventually retiring from the market. The illegal possession and smuggling of silver are forbidden, and infractors will be severely punished by the law. The government also announced the establishment of a new "Currency Stabilisation Fund" that allows purchasing and selling foreign currency, which we hope will maintain the hopes of the people on the newly established currency."
 DH_CHI_Economy.8.a:0 "Good riddance to the silver thorn"

 DH_CHI_Economy.9.t:0 "The Economy Improves!"
 DH_CHI_Economy.9.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon] After an initial period of implementation, it appears our new currency policies are beginning to show signs of success. In Shanghai, wholesale prices are approaching levels that were seen just before the economic downturn. The most apparent changes, however, seem to be occurring in the rural villages. Market values for crops and livestock are rising steadily, while the average farmer’s expenses have remained mostly flat. With commodity prices increasing, many of our agricultural sectors are reporting break-even budgets and a handful are reporting profits! While on the whole there is more work to be done, with purchasing power increasing, further economic improvement and stabilization is expected in the coming months."
 DH_CHI_Economy.9.a:0 "A Rebound for the Farmers!"

 DH_CHI_Economy.10.t:0 "Inflation Spirals Out of Control!"
 DH_CHI_Economy.10.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon] When our economy seemed that it was about to recover, disaster strikes once again. Printing money in mass to support the new currency proved to be a great mistake, as inflation started to grow out of control. The supposed solution to fix the problem of the silver standard only created another one even bigger. As a result, prices are skyrocketing, threatening the livelihoods of millions of farmers across the countryside. Even worse: it is likely that our situation could worsen even more if we go to war. Since we need money to improve the economy and repay our loans, it is unsure how long this inflation is going to last."
 DH_CHI_Economy.10.a:0 "Damn it!"

 DH_CHI_Economy.11.t:0 "Bank Run!"
 DH_CHI_Economy.11.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon] Panic on the streets of our urban cities! Fueled by the news of Japan’s Declaration of War, Chinese citizens across Nanjing and Shanghai have rushed to their local banks to withdraw whatever money they can. Morale is low as people are desperate to empty their accounts and keep their finances close. Some banks are taking measures to limit the amount customers can withdraw on a given day, others are closing altogether. Government bonds are being sold back at the highest rate on record and consequently, the value of our guarantees is plummeting. While we expected some chaos initially if the situation continues to escalate, we may have to intervene in order to keep our economic condition afloat during this crisis."
 DH_CHI_Economy.11.a:0 "Maybe I should go to the bank too?"

 ### Operation Nekka
 DH_CHI_Operation_Nekka.1.t:0 "An Ultimatum from the Kwantung Army"
 DH_CHI_Operation_Nekka.1.d:0 "To whom it may concern,\n\nThe act perpetrated by the Northeastern Army yesterday on January 1, 1933 is an unacceptable act on many fronts. They have violated the national sovereignty of the State of Manchuria without due cause, have harassed, intimidated, and even attacked soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army without any cause whatsoever, and have caused irreparable damage to the fragile peace in the region. We of the Empire of Japan, whose sole duty is the protection of the State of Manchuria's sovereignty, has seen the Northeastern Army, and by extension the Republic of China, as warmongers who have no restraint in violating Manchuria's sovereignty and independence.\n\nAs such, we hereby demand the cessation of hostilities along the Shanhaiguan sector of the Manchurian-ROC border. The Northeastern Army's 626th Regiment and all other troops of the Northeastern Army are to hereby evacuate from the area swiftly and with haste. Failure to concede to our demands will result in a military response by the Empire of Japan.\n\nDo not test our resolve."
 DH_CHI_Operation_Nekka.1.a:0 "It is humiliating, but we must kow-tow to the Rising Sun..."
 DH_CHI_Operation_Nekka.1.b:0 "How dare these Japanese scum to threaten us, get this out of my sight!"

 DH_CHI_Operation_Nekka.2.t:0 "A Report from Shanhaiguan"
 DH_CHI_Operation_Nekka.2.d:0 "Shanhaiguan is an important strategic position of the Great Wall that separates Manchuria from China. It was in this place where the armies of Prince Dorgon defeated the forces of the rebel Shun dynasty in 1644, assuring the rule of the Qing for the following centuries. History repeated itself once again when another army took control of the pass, but it was a far more ruthless and powerful opponent.\n\nUsing an alleged grenade attack as an excuse, a Japanese commander of the Kwantung Army ordered the men of the 626th Regiment to evacuate the pass. Naturally, this blatant violation of our sovereignty just to take control of the position (that included calling our soldiers "terrorists") was rejected by the garrison. The attack came shortly after. Using improvised bamboo ladders, the Japanese tried to make their way into the pass. Despite having only a bunch of light weapons and the ancient fortifications from the Ming Dynasty as defense, our men made a heroic stand against the Japanese attack. The fight quickly became a vicious close-quarters brawl, with men falling on both sides at the edge of bayonets and broadswords. But even bravery can't overcome the combined power of tanks, planes, warships and armored trains, and the garrison had to evacuate the position after days of brutal fighting.\n\nNot even this masterpiece of human fortification and symbol of Chinese national pride could stop the Japanese onslaught. The cruelty of modern warfare doesn't care at all about the remains of the past. Our reports indicate that the Japanese plan to concentrate their advance towards the mountains of Rehe. The Kwantung Army shows no intention of stopping at the Great Wall."
 DH_CHI_Operation_Nekka.2.a:0 "This barbarian scum will pay for this!"

 DH_CHI_Operation_Nekka.3.t:0 "Japan is claiming Rehe!"
 DH_CHI_Operation_Nekka.3.d:0 "Once again, the Kwantung Army is grasping for justification on taking more parts of our Northern Territory. According to a communique from senior officials, the Japanese are claiming that the province of Rehe is a historical portion of Manchuria, even though it has been under Chinese dominion for nearly 300 years. In fact, previous Qing Emperors would spend summers in the region, visiting the Great Wall and staying in the Mountain Resort at Chengde. Despite that, Kwantung officials are pushing that Rehe was stolen from the Manchu people and are seeking a way to undermine our influence in the area. Obviously we have sent a response that the claims are absolutely baseless and we shall defend our sovereign territory.\n\nIt is unlikely, given the history of Japanese aggression in Manchukuo, that the situation will be dropped anytime soon. Furthermore, our scouts observing Japanese movements north of the area are sending reports of large supply convoys as well as increased and suspicious troop activity. Unfortunately, even with our rebuttal to the Japanese, a war could be on the frontier within a matter of days."
 DH_CHI_Operation_Nekka.3.a:0 "The Japanese have no bounds..."

 DH_CHI_Operation_Nekka.4.t:0 "Japanese Delegates meeting with General Tang!"
 DH_CHI_Operation_Nekka.4.d:0 "In our ongoing conflict, Tang Yulin is currently ruling the region of the Rehe. The so-called "toad general" doesn't exactly have the best of records. In addition to his unpopular land taxes to buy properties in Tianjin, his tendency to accept extortions, and his lavish and extravagant banquets, he also controls the majority of the opium trade in Rehe. However, this particular incident proves that even the most corrupt generals aren't willing to sell the country to the enemy. It came to us that the Japanese meet General Tang to convince him to support their takeover of the Rehe region. Surprisingly enough, the governor refused the offer, which led to the Japanese trying to conquer the region. This should speak very highly of the governor for refusing to defect to the Japanese. However, there are already rumors that General Tang plans to leave Rehe with his wealth, which speaks volumes in how ill-prepared our forces are."
 DH_CHI_Operation_Nekka.4.a:0 "Everyone has standards"

 DH_CHI_Operation_Nekka.5.t:0 "The Catastrophic Rehe Incident"
 DH_CHI_Operation_Nekka.5.d:0 "The incident at the border has been nothing but one catastrophe after another. The ruthless Kwantung Army convinced their weak Emperor to authorize an invasion of the Rehe province, and our forces are unable to stop the attack. The local commander Tang Yulin is unprepared to face the attack, ignoring the orders of Marshal Zhang Xueliang. Soldiers are surrendering in mass, some even defecting to the enemy. While the National Revolutionary Army doesn't lack competent commanders or brave soldiers willing to protect China, the lack of training and equipment makes it impossible to resist an enemy that is roughly equal in size.\n\nThe result of the poor state of our armed forces is evident. The Kwantung Army took Chaoyang and Chifeng, only encountering token resistance from Sun Dianying's forces. Eventually, Japanese tanks reached the capital of Rehe, Chengde. Our reinforcements arrived too late to save the province from the combined strength of the Japanese and Manchukuo armies. The NRA managed to put a better fight at the Lengkou Pass despite being armed with swords, but overwhelming Japanese firepower forced them to retreat. Only a couple of obsolete fortifications stand now between Northern China and the Kwantung Army.\n\nThe League of Nations supported our claim that Manchukuo is an illegitimate state, but this gesture doesn't mean anything if it doesn't translate in support to stop the Japanese aggression. We didn't want this battle in the first place, and it is obvious now that we can't win at all. It seems that our only choice is to accept whatever demands the Kwantung Army decides to make."
 DH_CHI_Operation_Nekka.5.a:0 "What a disaster!"

 DH_CHI_Operation_Nekka.6.t:0 "The Rehe Secession"
 DH_CHI_Operation_Nekka.6.d:0 "After several meetings with provincial leaders, army officers and diplomats, we have reached an inescapable conclusion. With the Kwangtung Army itching to launch an attack into southern Manchuria and knowing our positional defenses in the area, mounting a successful defense of Rehe appears to be an impossible task. We are simply spread too thin in too large an area, especially with the Japanese’s ability to rapidly redeploy their forces. The outlook is expectedly dire among high command as well, for they too know it is an unworkable situation.\n\nTherefore, at the direction of the government and the army, we are drafting a letter to formally cede control of the province to the Kwangtung Army. The letter will state that while we don’t believe in the insane notation that Rehe is a modern part of Manchuria, avoiding a costly war between Asian superpowers is the best outcome for everyone. Privately, backing down will allow us an even more precious commodity than land: time. High Command is creating detailed maps of the area so that when we eventually have offensive plans in place, we can destroy the Manchukuo puppet and evict the Japanese from the mainland itself.\n\nUnfortunately, foreign powers will see this as an appeasement. We will order our officials to try and spin this in some possible positive way, but villages all along the border will see this outcome as the central government’s inability to defend the frontiers. Our rule will be challenged on the fringes of our domain and surely more crises will come from this decision. But it will maintain the status quo, at least for the time being. "
 DH_CHI_Operation_Nekka.6.a:0 "A humiliating defeat, but a humble decision"

 ### Tanggu Truce
 DH_CHI_Tanggu_Truce.1.t:0 "A Meeting in Tianjin"
 DH_CHI_Tanggu_Truce.1.d:0 "Following our staggering defeat from the Japanese in Rehe, we find ourselves facing pressure on all fronts. The civil war rages on, providing ample distraction for the National Army in the face of an external invasion. Thus, when we received the invitation for negotiations, we were in no position to argue.\n\nThe talks are set to take place in the Tanggu District of Tianjin. Whilst it is unlikely, we cannot help but hope for favorable terms. With the backing of the League of Nations and numerical superiority, the Japanese menace cannot sustain a full-scale invasion of mainland China. Perhaps they will be satisfied with the low-hanging fruit of Manchuria, an economic boon on its own. Either way, this has been a humiliating defeat for the Kuomintang, one which will not go without retribution."
 DH_CHI_Tanggu_Truce.1.a:0 "Perhaps the bleeding can finally stop..."

 DH_CHI_Tanggu_Truce.2.t:0 "The Issue of Manchuria"
 DH_CHI_Tanggu_Truce.2.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the Japanese marauders refuse to return Manchuria to its rightful owner, instead investing in the legitimacy of the new Manchukuo Empire, tarnishing the legacy of the Qing at every accord. With Puyi’s betrayal to his countrymen cemented, there is nothing left to do. The invaders will retain control over all territory north of the Great Wall, leaving millions of Chinese citizens under the oppressive thumb of Hirohito. Unfortunately, with the communist threat looming over the horizon, we can spare little blood nor sweat in the defense of extremity territories such as Manchuria. We will have to cut our losses and move on."
 DH_CHI_Tanggu_Truce.2.a:0 "A small price to pay for our survival"

 DH_CHI_Tanggu_Truce.3.t:0 "The Issue of Militarization"
 DH_CHI_Tanggu_Truce.3.d:0 "The bastards have gone too far! In the wake of their recent successes in negotiations, the Japanese have used their leverage to establish a disruptive demilitarized zone extended one hundred kilometers south of the Great Wall, with the wall itself remaining under Japanese control as a “security measure” of sorts. With our main defenses rendered useless, we have no choice but to withdraw from the zone, leaving the outskirts of Peiping defenseless. The zone is to be policed by a Japanese-supervised Peace Preservation Corps, maintaining order in lieu of an organized Kuomintang police force. The situation is dire, but the urbans are not lost yet. We may still recover!"
 DH_CHI_Tanggu_Truce.3.a:0 "At least conflict is out of the question..."

 DH_CHI_Tanggu_Truce.4.t:0 "The Issue of Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies"
 DH_CHI_Tanggu_Truce.4.d:0 "It was far too optimistic to assume we would have any sway over the happenings of the demilitarized zone. The peace talks grew especially rowdy following the announcement that there would be several secret clauses to the armistice, specifically regarding the administration of the zone and makeup of the Peace Preservation Corps. Whilst the Kwantung Army is permitted to patrol the area inside the zone to ensure compliance, all members of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies are barred from entry, thus ensuring that the Japanese have absolute control over the region. It would seem as though the demilitarized zone was simply a pretext to expand Kwantung influence into the continent. Caving to their demands has bought us time at the expense of the future."
 DH_CHI_Tanggu_Truce.4.a:0 "They are still rebels nonetheless..."

 DH_CHI_Tanggu_Truce.5.t:0 "The Tanggu Truce"
 DH_CHI_Tanggu_Truce.5.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon] The Imperial Japanese hostility towards our great Republic was more than apparent, and their intent to act on that aggression was proven at the Mukden Incident. Our armies tried their best to brace themselves against the unrelenting forces of the Japanese, but our country is in desperate need of modernization before we can put up any effective resistance. The smoldering villages and the cries of children in the streets is able proof that our military isn't doing its job as it should. The humiliating losses our ground forces are suffering against the Imperialist Japanese have forced us to review the option of brokering peace with them, although we don’t expect a fair deal with the imperialist dogs. We are backed into a corner.\n\nThe League’s pitiful condemnation of the Japanese invasion of Manchuria proves that the League is too incompetent to protect the sovereignty of our nation and that it is up to us to preserve the Republic. We managed to meet with representatives of the Japanese government and negotiate an end to the bloody conflict that has been ravaging the north. The Japanese demands were straight to the point, we were to extend a demilitarized zone 100 kilometers south of the Great Wall from Beijing to Tianjin, with the Great Wall itself strictly under Japanese control. In our current position, we have no other choice but to sign the unfair agreement, either that or face the onslaught of the rogue armies of the Japanese Empire.\n\nThe traitorous Puyi sits atop his throne in the new Empire of Manchukuo, a mere loyal dog to the Japanese, while they reap the fruits of victory and our nation continues to suffer at the hands of the neglectful League of Nations, we must bide our time, Puyi and the Japanese will pay."

 DH_CHI_Trautmann.1.d:0 "We have been engaged in war with the Japanese for some time now, and it has not necessarily gone in our favour, but there is a potential way of preserving our country’s sovereignty and independence indefinitely. We have been good friends with the German government for many years now and considering their recently warming relations with our enemy, it is in their best interest to have both of us stop fighting.\n\nGermany’s ambassador to us, Oskar Trautmann has approached us about the possibility of mediating peace talks, which if successful, could prove highly useful, as we would be fully able to focus our efforts on the threat of the communist insurgents within our country. Despite this, we will not bow down to our enemy by accepting a deal that is unfavourable, putting us in a spot worse than the one we are currently in. With this in mind, we may choose to reject Trautmann’s offer to save us from potentially wasting time we could devote towards winning the war."

 DH_CHI_Trautmann.2.d:0 "Scandal! Now with peace between us and the Empire of Japan seeming like a real possibility, these goddamm Imperialists have decided to swat hand away we extended to them, instead opting to spit on our attempts of reconciliation!\n\nAfter the first rounds of negotiations and some help by our mediator Oskar Trautmann, we had presented the first draft of a potential peace treaty to the Japanese, which would have been beneficial for both sides. True it was still a treaty of defeat for us, seeing as we would have to give up some Territory in Mongolia, establish a DMZ at the border and make Trade confessions to the Japanese it still would have meant a quick end to the war and peace between our nation.\n\nNow the Japanese delegation has returned after considering our initial offer and has promptly rejected it, presenting a new „improved“ treaty to us. And a truly outrageous treaty it is. Like in the previous Treaty we would have been forced to give up Inner Mongolia, while also establishing an even larger DMZ, one which would make any meaningful defense of the border against the Japanese simply not possible. Furthermore, we would have to make even further concessions,s which we inevitably would have to pay by shipping off almost the entirety of our spare industry to Japan.\n\nTrautmann already tried to convince the Japanese to reconsider their terms, but they have remained adamant. Now it remains for us to decide: Is this treaty worth the peace or should we rally ourselves for the continuation of the war?"

 DH_CHI_Trautmann.3.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon] It seems that once again the Japanese have rejected our proposals for Peace and have thus terminated the peace talks, initiated by Oskar Trautmann. Even when we offered the Japanese wide-reaching concessions in the form of land, money, industry, and more, the Imperialist Empire, driven by their greed and will to dominate the entirety of Asia, have chosen to push for harders terms, terms we simply could not fulfill. And so the war will once again continue, bringing suffering to millions of people.\n\nPerhaps it was foolish of us to push for peace, maybe the Japanese interpreted this a weakness to exploit or a sign that we considered the war unwinnable, but they will soon find that they are dead wrong. Our resistance will continue, unhindered by appeasement or politics, determined to struggle for survival we will fight this war to the last man and the last bullet. This war will either be China's greatest victory or its final defeat, a middle ground is no longer possible. The Japanese made sure of that."

 DH_CHI_Trautmann.4.d:0 "After rounds of diplomatic talks, there appears to be a light at the end of the long tunnel. Ambassador Trautmann has led the negotiations between the Kwantung Army and our government for weeks now. It has been a chaotic conference, as walkout attempts have occurred on multiple topics. One occurrence leading to a week long pause, with Trautmann managing to reel both parties back to the table. It is clear there is an undisclosed German desire in peace between our countries but why remains a mystery. Regardless, our nation is weary and peace is desirable, on certain terms.\n\nThe drafted terms have been approved by both Trautmann and Germany itself. Japan is insisting the terms will only be binding for a brief time, so a decision is needed quickly. A summary follows:\n\n    Inner Mongolian autonomy, from both Japan and Chinese influence.\n\n    There will be two new demilitarized zones, one between Manchukuo and our northern frontier, and in Shanghai itself, with an international police presence.\n\n  All anti-Japanese policies enacted will be ceased.\n\nJapanese and Chinese forces will cooperate against communism in and around Asia.\n\n  Japanese goods will be subjected to lower tariffs.\n\n  Foreign nation’s properties and rights in China will be respected.\n\nWith a peaceful solution in our sight, some government officials are split. We could end the conflict and focus on the communists in the south, but this could only be a momentary peace and the Japanese could break the terms, knowing how distrustful Kwantung officials are. Others are suggesting that a breakthrough in the north could come soon and ending the war now would halt a potential victory. In any case, China stands on a knife-edge and our nation is exhausted. How do we proceed?"

With Germany sidelined from this proposal, our best facilitator can only watch as the terms are read aloud. To say they are a brutal opposite to the original treaty would be a vast understatement. They are laid out as the following:\n\n   Manchukuo will be diplomatically recognized by the Republic of China\n\n    Inner Mongolia will retain autonomy from Japan and China\n\n    All anti-Japanese and anti-Manchukuo policies enacted by our government will be ceased.\n\n Japanese, Manchukuo and Chinese forces will cooperate in the annihilation of communism in and around Asia.\n\n  China will pay war reparations to Japan, the amount remaining conspicuously undisclosed.\n\n    The original two DMZ proposals would be included but expanded on the Chinese side.\n\n  New drafted trade agreements between China, Japan and Manchukuo\n\nThe war reparations clause alone is enough to give serious pause to our negotiating team. When the further DMZ expansions are read, audible gasps are heard from several administrators. Upon extended counseling with military officers and government officials, many have stated that the new DMZ border would be nearly impossible for our forces to defend. It remains to be seen how the war reparations will be divided but, knowing the Japanese, it is expected to be harsh. How do we respond to the proposition?"

 CHI_Reward_Loyalty:0 "Reward Loyal Command"
 CHI_Reward_Loyalty_desc:0 "Since the dawn of the Warlord Era, premiums have been placed on loyalty to a local leader or faction. Military devotions have kept some in power well beyond the expectations of many political experts. If we are to be seen as the unifying force in China, we must create a system of rewards and benefits for those who show commitment to our command. Forming bonds between soldiers, officers and their generals would produce a hierarchy of allegiance. Dedication must be placed above all if we are to succeed in the struggle for the nation."

 CHI_Modern_Fighting_Force:0 "Modern in Practice"
 CHI_Modern_Fighting_Force_desc:0 "Being an up-to-date fighting force requires more than just polished rifles and brand new boots. In today’s advancing technological battlefield, a modern soldier needs to understand his equipment, tactics, provisions, and his knowledge of all things warfare. Updating our training and drills will require a tremendous amount of effort on the part of our military, but it will infinitely allow for better preparedness and give our forces a significant advantage, whether fighting the Kwantung Army or the Communists."

 CHI_Mass_Produced_Warfare:0 "Mass Produced Warfare"
 CHI_Mass_Produced_Warfare_desc:0 "Seemingly, no matter what government was in charge, China has always had an equipment issue on the battlefield. Our population size is just too large for our smaller industrial base to quickly handle. Mobilization of bodies rarely equals the equipment needed for each soldier, much less advanced weapon systems, such as tanks or airplanes. Overcoming this problem will be difficult, but through streamlining our existing industrial processes and heavily investing in newer military factories, our government can lay the groundwork for a new Chinese revolution in manufacturing and mass warfare."

Many upper government officials marvel at the prowess of America’s gold standards in war industry such as the Ford Motor Company or Douglas Aircraft. If we can bolster our own design firms and contract them to create and build different armaments for our forces, it would create a great sense of national pride and prove to the world that our Nationalist government is the true and only legitimate authority over China."

 CHI_Open_Taiyuan_Arsenal:0 "Open Taiyuan Arsenal Branches"
 CHI_Open_Taiyuan_Arsenal_desc:0 "It is no secret that our current industrial base is laughably unprepared to supply an Army the size of the NRA to a satisfying result and it shows, with a large portion of our soldiers being equipped with outdated rifles and little to no ammunition, while support weapons like machine guns and mortars being true rarities.\n\nSome divisions have seemingly reverted back to the middle ages and have started equipping their soldiers with swords, spears, and other primitive weapons due to the lack of other options.\n\nTo combat this grave state of affairs we will open a series of new arsenals, which will be used to produce to produce the arms and ammunition our army so desperately needs."

 CHI_Expand_Minsheng:0 "Expand Minsheng Industrial"
 CHI_Expand_Minsheng_desc:0 "While the recent improvements have helped us get back on track towards becoming an industrialized nation, the general state of our industry is still in an as sorry state. To further expand our industry and keep the current pace, in regards to industrial development, we should seek to further expand the Minsheng Industrial, one of the biggest factories in China.\n\nThis would allow us to further increase our production capacity, while also providing us with civilian factories, that in the event of a foreign invasion or escalated civil war, would be able to provide our army with the supplies it will need."

 CHI_Qishuyuan_Contracts:0 "Qishuyuan Machinery Contracts"
 CHI_Qishuyuan_Contracts_desc:0 "The most important factor in effectively industrializing a country is the availability of sufficient machinery to construct and maintain the desired factories, construction lines, and infrastructure. Sadly as it is with almost everything modern, China desperately lacks the needed machines to make any meaningful steps towards becoming a modern, industrialized nation.\n\n To amend this rather pitful state we must reach out towards a variety of companies inside and outside of China and offer them lucrative market opportunities in China and a stable contract with the government as a guaranteed customer, in exchange for producing and selling modern industrial machinery inside China."

 CHI_Overhaul_Logistics:0 "Overhal Logistical Systems"
 CHI_Overhaul_Logistics_desc:0 "Logistics in China have always been a tricky affair with the country encompassing an area of 9.000.000 square kilometers, many of which possess nothing resembling any sort of modern infrastructure, while other areas are controlled by warlords who often obstruct our supply lines, due to either political or personal reasons. It is thus no surprise that the logistic of the NRA is a similar mess with our logistics office simply not able to adequately supply our troops, wherever they currently might be. This has to stop as soon as possible if we want to have any chance against our foreign enemies. \n\nWe will thus completely overhaul the current process involved in supplying our army, while simultaneously expanding the number of logistics officers and supply depots throughout the country. While this might not be enough to completely solve our problems, it will still represent a step in the right direction and solve the most serious issues."
