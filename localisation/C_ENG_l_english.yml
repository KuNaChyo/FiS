 DH_UK_special.1.t:0 "Our Finest Hour"
 DH_UK_special.1.d:0 "We now stand alone in the face of tyranny; The German war machine has overrun the continent with their new military strategy, knocking out the Low Countries and France in a single lightning-fast campaign. So far British diplomacy has not been fruitful in convincing others to fight alongside the Commonwealth, and it will not be long before the Luftwaffe will seek control over Britain’s airspace. Setting up a new ground-controlled network for intercepting enemy bombers will prove vital for protecting our industry. Let the Battle for Britain begin."
 DH_UK_special.1.a:0 "We shall never surrender!" 
 
 DH_UK_special.2.t:0 "The End of the Beginning"
 DH_UK_special.2.d:0 "Allied forces have landed on the beaches of Europe, establishing a foothold following the operations of D-Day. The tide is turning, as more and more men and material are brought ashore, increasing our presence on the continent. Liberation is at hand for the many peoples of Western Europe, but even with plenty of boots on the ground it will still be a long way to Berlin. Yet, a successful land invasion can not be regarded as the end, and not even as the beginning of the end, but it is perhaps “the end of the beginning."

 DH_commonwealth.1.d:0 "With the isle of Britain lost the United Kingdom can no longer be regarded as a one of the Great Powers, members to the British Commonwealth have started questioning the nature of the relationship. Even though advantages of remaining are few, a complete fracture of the Commonwealth would undermine the war effort. Others emphasise that independence is prefered now that the UK can no longer guarantee its member's security."

 DH_Britain.1.t:0 "The Jarrow March"
 DH_Britain.1.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]In a turn of recent events, 200 men from Jarrow have decided to march from Northumbria to London in protest of depression conditions. They wish to give a petition to the Prime Minister and his majesty's government to fund the reopening of their factories to get them back to work. It has gained support across the country from Labour MPs, local churches, and due to their non-violent law-abiding methods, they have gained huge respect across the nation. To many middle class, this is the first time they've truly seen the depressed areas. However, how the government reacts to the event could be very crucial."
 DH_Britain.1.A:0 "Send Relief to Jarrow"
 DH_Britain.1.B:0 "The King wishes to receive the marchers"
 
 DH_Britain.2.t:0 "The Crystal Palace burns!"
 DH_Britain.2.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]'This is the end of an age.' remarked a solemn Winston Churchill as he joined the thousands who came to Sydenham Hill, in London, to watch a magnificent, yet astoundingly sad blaze, engulfing the great Crystal Palace. Opened in 1851 in Hyde Park, before moving in 1852 to its current, and final resting place, the great monument of glass and steel stood as a symbol of the proud British Empire. It was a beacon of industrial greatness, truly capturing the glorious spirit of the Commonwealth. Reportedly, there was a small explosion in the women's coatroom, which escalated into the inferno, now visible in eight different counties. Recalling the words of Churchill, the age of the British empire seems to be coming to an end, and, as new powers emerge, it is our duty to leave the global stage in a dazzling blaze of glory!"
 DH_Britain.2.A:0 "This is the end of an age"
 
 DH_Britain.3.t:0 "The Hobbit Published"
 DH_Britain.3.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The children of England have been taken by surprise, with the publishing of ""The Hobbit, or There and Back Again,"" by renowned author and war veteran J. R. R. Tolkien. The book carry readers by a magical quest, leaving them, child and adult alike, in absolute awe as the adventure goes on episode after episode, until it reaches the climax with massive battles that shape the fantastical world of the Middle-Earth. The critical and financial success of this work will surely embolden Tolkien's wish for a sequel, and the new fans will impatiently await to return this world they have learned to love."
 DH_Britain.3.A:0 "Definitely worth a read!"
 
 DH_Britain.4.t:0 "Royal Family Evacuation"
 DH_Britain.4.d:0 "As the enemy force’s roll ever forward onto the capital, the decision has been made in both Houses of Parliament as well as the Royal Household to flee to safety and command the war effort from there. As such, His Majesty King George VI has ordered his family and the government to be escorted to Canada safely, himself being the last royal to leave London. Before leaving, he grants one final speech to the citizens and armed forces remaining in the city, telling them to fight strong, and no matter the cost to himself and his country, he shall return to rule this city once more."
 DH_Britain.4.A:0 "God Save the King!"
 
 DH_Britain.5.t:0 "Women, Children and Conservatives first"
 DH_Britain.5.d:0 "It has been revealed that Conservative politicians have been secretly evacuating themselves before those of the Opposition parties. Samuel Herbert, Aneurin Bevin and especially Clement Attlee have denounced such ‘Selfishness in a time of the utmost Crisis’. The resistance to the ever marching armies continues, however the thought of their leaders being so petty has damaged the mental image of King and Country."
 DH_Britain.5.A:0 "Tories..."

 DH_Britain.6.t:0 "Preparations for a March"
 DH_Britain.6.d:0 "Oswald Mosley is getting ready for a march through the streets of London. Fascism is on the rise; a civil war has broken out in Spain, and Hitler and Mussolini seem eager to fight us. He calls for a struggle in the "Jew-ridden and communistic" streets of Whitechapel, and many Blackshirts have rallied to his cause. He seems to want to provoke the communists into a full-out fight. We should probably intervene; the world seems geared towards another Great War, and we can't afford interior discontent. The only thing to do is to help one of the sides of this conflict. But which one?"
 DH_Britain.6.A:0 "We must ban the march! No fascists in Britain!"
 DH_Britain.6.B:0 "Allow the march."
 DH_Britain.6.C:0 "Allow the march, and send a police escort"

 DH_Britain.7.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Violence erupted on the streets of London today. Various anti-fascist demonstrators, among them communist, Jewish, anarchist, and socialist groups rallied to oppose a march of Oswald Mosley's British  Union of Fascists. 6,000 - 7,000 bobbies were assigned to protect the nationalist demonstration, but were unable to clear the path of roadblocks set up by the counter-demonstrators. Almost 20,000 anti-fascists arrived to stop the march, and started a riot against the police as the peaceful march turned to bloodshed. What happens next remains too be seen, but this could end up as a victory for the communists, for the fascists, or perhaps bloodshed might be avoided."

 DH_Britain.9.d:0 "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]The RMS Queen Mary, a tribute to Britains naval authority and innovations, has just set sail on her maiden voyage. On 27 May 1936, a passenger liner known as the RMS Queen Mary made her first trip and would sail the Northern Atlantic all the way until 1967. She now rests on Long Beach, California, and is regularly kept clean and polished."
 DH_Britain.9.A:0 "Bon Voyage!"

 DH_Britain.10.t:0 "Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement"
 DH_Britain.10.d:0 "Due to the ongoing Anglo-Irish trade war we wish to ease economic tensions between us and the Irish to achieve prosperity among the British peoples, with this we wish to facilitate the 'Anglo-Irish trade agreement' in which the 20% tariffs both Ireland and Britain placed on their imported goods are to be abolished. Ireland is also to pay £10 million to Britain for the "land annuities" derived from financial loans granted to Irish farmers by the British government to enable them to purchase lands under the Irish Land Acts"
 DH_Britain.10.A:0 "Sign it"
 DH_Britain.10.B:0 "The Irish are insane"

 DH_Britain.11.t:0 "Germany Calling"
 DH_Britain.11.d:0 "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]A stray fox has left the woodlands. Born within our midst, William Joyce has turned his faith away from us. The known zealous Hitler- fanatic has left the United States and, with the European powderkegs’ fuse about to catch fire once more set foot on german soil to avoid confrontation with the authorities. His Nazi propaganda to Britain from Germany is a thorn in our side, which asks to be removed."
 DH_Britain.11.A:0 "So you Germans believe that you can defeat the superior British forces! Haw, Haw."

 DH_Britain.12.t:0 "The Blitz Begins"
 DH_Britain.12.d:0 "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]The German Air force, on this night have begun a ruthless bombardment of London. The fall of France has brought about the greatest challenge in the history of Britain since Napoleon, we now face imminent threat of invasion by foreign German forces. The Luftwaffe has taken to the skies, attempting to take the will of the British people away, trying to take the fight out of us but we will not falter.  ""Never was so much owed by so many to so few"" Prime Minister Winston Churchill has stated concerning the brave RAF fly boys who have taken to the skies to beat back the Nazi menace. This will no doubt be the greatest threat that the British isles has ever faced, Hermann Goering and his Luftwaffe will be a large obstacle towards our victory but through fire, fury and determination we will achieve victory against Goering's Luftwaffe and Hitler's Germany. The British people are staunch to the bone and this intense bombing of our homeland will only strengthen our morale, we shall never surrender and live on to the end, emerging victorious from the ashes!<For King and Country!>"
 DH_Britain.12.A:0 "Tragic!"

 DH_Britain.13.t:0 "Coventry Bombing"
 DH_Britain.13.d:0 "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]Damn the Irish, those fools. They know not of the greater evil that awaits them, the Axis powers that could very well soon control all of Europe. Aiding the Germans should not be the interest of the Irish; helping the Germans in bombing Britain only weakens us, and strengthens the wolf that will come for them when it sees fit."
 DH_Britain.13.A:0 "Let those Irish be DAMNED!"

 DH_Britain.14.t:0 "Altmark Incident"
 DH_Britain.14.d:0 "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]The Altmark Incident may have angered the neutral and peaceful Norwegians, but they know nothing about the oppression and the tyranny that the Jerry's would enforce upon them if given the chance. Although in their territory, the German tanker was carrying almost 300 British Prisoners of War, that, had we not rescued, could have well been tortured and killed by the evil Krauts. The captured men knew about this and they started a revolt, so they can be heard by our inspectors on the ship. Even though the Norwegians might be upset about this, they should know that we would not violate their neutrality."
 DH_Britain.14.A:0 "Surely nothing will come of this ,incident"

 DH_Britain.15.t:0 "Their Finest Our"
 DH_Britain.15.d:0 "This is their finest hour. They conquered Western Europe in a few weeks. They now swim in the great spoils of victory... How could we allow such tragedy? This new tactic, ""The Blitzkrieg"", or Lighting Warfare, as they call it, was very effective and although they had a small number of tanks, they were sufficient for a speedy breakthrough, through the Benelux and down into the heart of France. The ""famed"" Maginot Line was a complete waste of time, as they just went around it. We wasted the lives of many men, just to be utterly destroyed on every front.They will bomb our ports, airfields, bases and even the cities, which are full of terrified civilians.We must not be afraid, even though dark times are upon us and even though they are already planning the naval invasion of the British Isles."
 DH_Britain.15.A:0 "We will survive, as we did before!"

 DH_Britain.16.t:0 "Occupation of the Channel Islands"
 DH_Britain.16.d:0 "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]They've done it. They have stepped foot on British territory. The Channel Isles have fallen. They have destroyed France in so little time. Just the Germans. Our hopes for a quick Allied victory are destroyed, now it seems that this war will be an Axis victory. We must prepare for a desperate defense, the great defense of democracy in Europe. We will not fall, Brittania will not fall, Brittania will rule the waves and the winds. We will not let these "Sauerkrauts" think they are the leaders of the world, we will not let these National-Socialists destroy humanity just for their racial beliefs. We will never surrender!"
 DH_Britain.16.A:0 "Damn those Nazis"

 DH_Britain.17.t:0 "BBC Launches Regular Television Broadcast"
 DH_Britain.17.d:0 "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]The BBC has opened the world's first regular high-definition television service, from Alexandra Palace! Mere 14 years after its founding on October 18th, 1922, having already broadcasted his majesty King George the 5th, Edgar Wallace and Christopher Stone the British Broadcasting Corporation has once more set forth to conquer new fields of telecommunication."
 DH_Britain.17.A:0 "Interesting"

 DH_Britain.18.t:0 "Frank Whittle Ground-Tests the World's first jet engine"
 DH_Britain.18.d:0 "Frank Whittle, despite being rejected in 1930 by the RAF for his proposal, has now been given the scientific spotlight to create a jet engine for the British war effort. These engines use high velocity aircraft to intake air, and then mix it with fuel before the exhaust gases are exhaled at rapid velocity.The proposal was rejected due to budget cuts in the RAF as well as doubts into its effectiveness, however he has now been given full attention by the Royal Air Force. If this could be placed onto warplanes, it could give Britain a decisive advantage in the air war, and therefore the battles themselves"

 DH_Britain.32.t: "The Future of Warfare"
 DH_Britain.32.d: "The way in which modern war is turning is quite clear. The future of warfare is a war of movement - mechanised, armoured and motorised armies control the battlefield and our tactics must adapt along with them. Thus, we have assembled the best and brightest military minds, two of which have come up with new and revolutionary doctrines on how we should engage the enemy - however, we cannot simultaneously adopt these doctrines, for they are quite different.\n\nLiddell has proposed a doctrine of war in which economics is used as a method to drain the opposing nation of will to fight, holding the defensive until the enemy has been weakened sufficiently, then beginning a war of movement, constantly keeping the opponent on their toes until their defeat is assured. Fuller has proposed the utilisation of armoured forces in concentrated divisions to bypass, surround and destroy enemy strongpoints. Both utilise new technologies, specifically armour, in a high capacity. However, Fuller proposes the utilisation of stronger and more numerous armoured attack forces, potentially winning the war faster but with a higher risk attached should it fail.\n\nWe can only pick one doctrine, however. What style of war shall cast our nation headfirst into victory?"
 DH_Britain.32.A: "Go with the indirect approach"

 The_London_Economic_Conference_Does_not_Happen:0 "§BWe Won't Attend the London Economic Conference§!"
 
 DH_Britain.34.t: "The Italian Threat"
 DH_Britain.34.d: "The Kingdom of Italy, our ally in the Great War, has betrayed us. Mussolini's ambitions to build a new Roman Empire out of conquest and totalitarianism have made Italy a threat we cannot ignore. The Mediterranean is the fastest route to India, crown jewel of the empire, and must remain open to British shipping.\n\nOur colonial possessions in Egypt, the Sudan, and Malta all border Fascist Italy, and our forces in these areas will be reinforced and made ready for a potential war.\n\nContinued threats to Commonwealth interests in the Mediterranean will no longer be tolerated."
 DH_Britain.34.A: "We must put an end to Fascism."
 
 DH_Britain.35.t: "The Fascist Threat"
 DH_Britain.35.d: "Cruelty knows no bounds except when restrained by the people themselves. The ideals of the newly-arisen Third Reich and Italian Regime are in direct opposition to those of the British Empire and shall be treated as such.\n\nThe words of Stanley Baldwin cut deep into the veins of any who could support such a system of oppression. Bent on restriction rather than liberation; emphasizing control in place of freedom, the fascists know nothing of governance. The fragile peace of Europe teeters towards turmoil, and only firm action may prevent the spread of such dangerous ideas--firm action we are in no place to deliver. Only by calling upon the entire Empire may we maintain the balance we have worked so hard to keep. In the wake of war lies peace, which is merely a crackling ember for which the fascists to poke and prod, feigning a benign façade whilst stoking a young flame, ready to engulf Europe in a blazing inferno, reigniting the smoldering ashes of the Great War and embroiling the world once more in conflict."
 DH_Britain.35.A: "We must extinguish this flame before it is too late."
 
 DH_Britain.36.t: "The Public Order Act"
 DH_Britain.36.d: "With political tensions running high and extremism rampant, it is up to the government to curb such dangerous philosophies in the wake of an outward threat. The United Kingdom has been a bastion of democracy for over half a century, and we will not concede even an inch to those who wish to upset the balance. Henceforth, political marches must be cleared by local law enforcement before beginning, allowing us to cast a net over those we wish to censor for the greater good. In addition, donning political attire in a public meeting place is also banned, thus preventing virulent imagery to spread through our streets. The final tenants of the act ban informal political militias, thus decreasing the chances of violent uprisings and ensuring the police can respond to crimes of all kinds, including those perpetrated for the behoof of a politician’s agenda."
 DH_Britain.36.A: "Mosley must be neutralized at any cost."
 DH_Britain.36.B: "We must look to our own people before intervening abroad."
 
 DH_Britain.37.t: "The Unfair Treaty"
 DH_Britain.37.d: "Perhaps the greatest failure of the Entente was not the scuffed invasion of the Turks, but the deplorable treaty signed thereafter ending the war with Germany. Whilst heavy monetary reparations were forced upon Austria-Hungary in the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, they pale in comparison to the burden placed upon the Germans in the ‘War Guilt Clause,’ Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles. This clause placed sole moral and political responsibility for the war solely on the Germans’ bereaved shoulders, already tired from a decade of warfare. Needless to say, resentment runs high, partially our fault for supporting such unjust provisions. The weakness of the Weimar government only throws salt into the proverbial wounds suffered by such a strong nation. Be as that may, they were the primary aggressor, and thus the treaty was a necessity to assert dominance. Let us only hope they stay down..."

Relying on agents within our enemy's home is ineffective and may cost many Brits their lives.

Hugh Dowding, the Air Member for Supply and Research, has proposed an elegant solution; a large, dedicated land-line network covering our southern airspace, communicating directly with both the operators of CH and the RAF's many hangars. This should aid in developing a much faster response time and ensure that not a single bomber makes its way to striking distance."

That is why the Air Ministry engaged multiple British aircraft manufactures in 1931 for it's development . One of them 'Supermarine' has created a very fast one-seated fighter which meets all requirements. Although the first prototypes we're inconclusive, the last version nicknamed 'Spitfire' is said to have the answers to the previous problems . Of course the defense minister is still septic and has dispatch a team to test the aircraft. All we need now is to wait ."

 ENG_Hurricain:0 "The Hurricane"
 ENG_Hurricain_desc:0 "Rather than accepting the new, experimental models as the backbone of our Fighter Command, we have reached the conclusion that the concepts proposed by Hawker's Hurricane, of reliability and power under the well known design of a stiff, bulky monoplane, will be the most effective way of protecting our skies. It's perfect for interception missions against enemy attackers, and simple enough that the squadrons themselves can be tasked with repairs without any external support. Throughly tested and improved since its inception, such a piece would greatly improve the effectiveness of our air defenses."

 ENG_Bomber_Command_desc:0 "In this new age of warfare, the attack must come from the skies as it does from the ground. Secluded as we are on our home islands, the ideal strategy, should we have no allies on the continent, is to strike our enemies where it hurts most. Strategic bombers will pound our enemy to bits, dropping countless bombs over the home front as the Germans did back in the Great War, as we sit contentendly at home. However, we need to coordinate these attacks and put in place a system to organize the whole operation. A centralized, independent Bomber Command will provide the rigidity and structure we need to continue the fight in the air."

 ENG_Area_Bombing_Initiative_desc:0 "An expansion of our offensive air capabilities is on the line. We have to combat the current dire situation of the RAF Bomber Command.

The Spanish civil war has greatly shown the effectiveness of modern bombing raids, crippling both civil morale and industrial- as well as economic capabilities.

 ENG_Advanced_ASW_Tactics:0 "Advanced ASW Tactics"
 ENG_Advanced_ASW_Tactics_desc:0 "Altought we have progressed a great deal in our submarine technology, the methods to counter them have always been ad-hoc and shaky at best, like using barrel bombs or, sometimes, planes.

Our stranglehold on the world economy guarantees that should we wish, we could economically break any nation over a long period of time in a drawn out defensive war. Following the inevitable physical and psychological breakdown of the opposing nation's soldiers, as seen in the Great War, we can utilise our new technologies of mechanised and light armor to force their lines back and bring their nation to the negotiating table, without too much blood being spilt. Enough was drained from Europe in the Great War, we need not have another Lost Generation - and this style of war ensures it shall not come to pass again."
 
 ENG_The_Direct_Approach: "The Direct Approach"
 ENG_The_Direct_Approach_desc: "The new developments in armor and the displays we have seen of tanks melting away defensive lines has brought about a new way of thinking - the direct approach, to destroy our enemies in battle, rather than elsewhere. Using concentrated mechanised forces and air power as detailed in the '1919 Plan' can breach holes in the enemy's lines through which rapidly moving formations can advance and surround, cut off and destroy strongpoints, bringing total victory in the field and assuring us victory in the overall war. This style of war can easily end wars quickly if pulled off correctly. Economic war is dishonourable, brings about needless bloodshed overall and does not account for if the enemy can break through our own lines, while Direct Warfare ensures that honor is maintained and total victory assured. We will not have another Lost Generation, and the Iron Fist of Albion shall assure it!"

There are some radical theorists out there, like J.F.C. Fuller and B.H. Liddell Hart, who believe that the use of tanks and motorised vehicles, is the way forward. They may well be right in the long run, but the concept of large-scale armoured warfare that they are proposing is just that, a concept and is therefore unproven in its effectiveness.\n\nWe must develop our military doctrine beyond the trenches and utilize new technologies, there is no question about that, but we will not put our faith in these radical, untested theories, lest they completely fail and result in the safety of the British Empire being put into jeopardy."

Especially the prolific Japanese and American navies are investing heavily in this field, making sure that the skies are never empty above the pacific.

But that was just the beginning, that was just a glimpse of what ships in modern war would be like and the time to take the next step in the history of navies has finally come. Once again, we shall awe the world and build ships that will make the Dreadnoughts of the Great War seem like toy. We will develop and build Battleships so massive and awe-inducing, so heavy that no other name than “Super Heavy Battleship” will do them justice. And once these behemoths leave harbor, once our enemies are faced with the biggest ships ever to set sail, they will remember who it is that rules the seas."

Towns are expanding all over the region, with existing suburban districts expanding and entirely new ones undergoing construction. Brighton, in particular, has seen significant growth, with hundreds of new homes built in the modern and elegant art deco style.\n\nThe Ministry of Health has been a staunch proponent of homeownership, investing in housing development and promoting mortgages as a means of allowing Britons of all classes to work towards owning a home.

Under Baldwin's leadership, the Tories have shifted slightly to the left, accepting the welfare state and entering a coalition with Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government.

As a government, we must ensure that Britain, must stay committed to Peace in Europe and the World, lest we lose another generation in a conflict summoned by more hawkish nations.\nWhile the recent upheaval in the World will certainly makes this a difficult task, we will stay on the right track, never giving up on our quest to steer Europe away from another catastrophe. And even if we fail, let the history books say that it was not for a lack of trying!"
 
 ENG_Public_Order_Act:0 "Public Order Act"
 ENG_Public_Order_Act_desc:0 "Our democracy is under threat of violence, of violence by the fascist and nationalist forcing their agenda. We are a democracy, and we shall never let something like the political violence Germany suffered during the last decade happen here.\nTo prevent this we shall prohibit organizing, training, or equipping military wings of political parties as well the use of political uniforms, obligating the parties to get police consent for marches and prohibit any form of political agenda violence based advancement.\nThis will safeguard our homeland from becoming an internal battleground and improve public security."
 
 ENG_Baldwins_Rearmament:0 "Baldwin's Re-Armament"
 ENG_Baldwins_Rearmament_desc:0 "Despite rising tensions in Europe and Asia, rearmament is still incredibly unpopular among the British public. The Peace Ballot has shown that the people prefer economic sanctions and diplomatic action through the League of Nations over armed conflict. The Labour-led opposition and its leader, Clement Atlee, also strongly oppose any effort to expand the armed forces.\n\nThe Royal Air Force, in particular, has fallen behind its continental counterparts; intelligence suggests the German Luftwaffe will soon be superior to the RAF both in numbers and in aircraft production capacity. Despite its unpopularity, at least limited rearmament is necessary for the nation's defense.\n\nThe Air Ministry suggests building aircraft manufacturing facilities 'in the shadow' of existing automobile factories, allowing them to draw on existing engineering expertise. Additionally, should the worst come to pass, automobile production lines can be converted to build aircraft instead."
 
 ENG_An_Unfair_Treaty:0 "An Unfair Treaty"
 ENG_An_Unfair_Treaty_desc:0 "The Treaty of Versailles remains perhaps the harshest treaty ever inflicted upon a nation. Germany was our enemy in the Great War, yes, but the Austro-Hungarian Empire were the true initiators of that deadly conflict. However, in the end, it is the Germans who suffer untold amounts from this treaty.\nThe German populace now secretly seethes with anger at this unfair treaty. Their desperation to get it abolished leads them to turn and follow radical parties, who promise salvation, without logical reason. The full hatred of the German Reich targets France and the British Empire. It is our responsibility to reach out to Germany and discuss the future of this treaty.\nOur delegation will meet with German representatives in Berlin. A public acknowledgement of the cruelties of this treaty will help the Germans understand our stance on the situation, if only subtly. The German leadership will understand that we will be lenient regarding the requirements of the treaty.\nWe will be closer to the end of the Versailles Treaty. One step closer to maintaining the peace."
 
 ENG_WW1_Debt_Relief:0 "WW1 Debt Relief"
 ENG_WW1_Debt_Relief_desc:0 "During the Great War, the British government borrowed vast sums of money, at first from American banks and later from the American government itself to finance our war effort. From 1914 to 1919, the national debt increased a hundredfold, and by the 1920s, HM Treasury was spending more on repaying the Americans than funding our armed forces. Despite this somewhat embarrassing state of affairs, we were slowly repaying our loans, and it seemed we would eventually square our debt with the Americans.\n\nUnfortunately, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed made continued payments impossible. Recognizing this, President Hoover granted a one-year suspension of all war loan payments in 1931, but it wasn't enough for us to get back on our feet.\n\nLike so many debtors, we will have to ask for more time. HM Treasury suggests that we ask the Americans for another suspension of payment until the economy recovers."

 ENG_Home_Defence:0 "Home Defense"
 ENG_Home_Defence_desc:0 "The Home Isles are the base of power within our global empire, and the home to millions of British people, our people. We as a government have an obligation to prevent a foreign invader from taking one step on British soil, and a duty to protect our people’s home and culture from destruction. In line with this responsibility to our people and our empire, we shall turn our island into a fortress, using the most modern radar, anti-air, coastal fortifications and strategies to prevent the dreaded nightmare that is the enemy on our streets."
 
 ENG_Peace_in_our_Time:0 "Peace in our Time"
 ENG_Peace_in_our_Time_desc:0 "An entire generation of our youth was destroyed in the First World War. We were victorious in nothing but name. Britain cannot last without its children. An army cannot last without its soldiers.\n\nWhat must follow are steps to ensure that a war does not break out. We are hard-pressed on all sides by wolves and sharks, preying on the weakness that came after the Great War. Thousands of years of culture and heritage on this steadfast island must stand.\n\nEven if it means we have to play as the 'coward' for once in the vast history of this empire. Members of the current government believe the horrors enacted on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles were overly harsh, and suggest we sit back and watch as the Reich recovers. From there, we can see their true intentions. The doctrine of appeasement is being contemplated as our new foreign policy to the enemies that plague us. Victory must come over pride. Without victory, there is no survival.\n\nPerhaps it would be wise to wait cautiously, for now, preserving the status quo. If we must fight war, it will not be today. Today, we celebrate Peace in Our Time!"
 
 ENG_Peace_in_our_Time_2:0 "Peace in our Time?"
 ENG_Peace_in_our_Time_2_desc:0 "The British people have never relished war, and the terrible losses of the Great War have made the prospect of armed conflict even more unpopular. The public responds to even the slightest rearmament with charges of warmongering and rampant jingoism- they demand that we placate the tiger with a bowl of milk.\n\nWar is to be avoided, yes- but not at any cost. Someday, the price of peace may be too high; and when that day comes, we must be ready to fight for it. Britain will not give up all she bled for with the stroke of a diplomat's pen.\n\nWhile we will spare no effort to find a peaceful solution to the crises that threaten the international order we built in Paris, none shall forget Britain paid for that order in blood. Should it be necessary, we will fight once more to protect the peace."
 
 ENG_Allow_for_Full_Rearmament:0 "Allow for Full Re-Armament"
 ENG_Allow_for_Full_Rearmament_desc:0 "Ever since the Great War, rearmament has always been a divisive issue, but considering the current events on the world stage, we must begin to fully rearm. These efforts will not be to wage war but to act as a safety net in case our attempts at a diplomatic solution do not succeed. Our empire is vast, and the full rearmament of our armed forces will require much time, but with the massive amount of resources at our disposal, and proper coordination, we can surely prepare His Majesty’s Armed Forces in time for the potential major conflict on the horizon."
 
 ENG_Starve_the_Germans:0 "Starve the Germans"
 ENG_Starve_the_Germans_desc:0 "Our victory in the Great War was not easily earnt, for every day presented crucial decisions for the British Military High Command to make. One particular strategy was undeniably effective. The North Sea Blockade brought the war a milestone closer to its end, one missing shipment for Germany at a time. We starved the German populace into surrender.\n\nNow that tensions with Germany are arising once more, we may need to starve them again. Most crucial to the completion of this mission is to choke out the sources of their resources. Namely, Sweden and Romania. These two nations pose a grave threat to us should they trade with Germany during a prospective conflict. Sweden can provide essential tungsten to fund the German war economy, while Romania hosts vast oilfields in Ploiești that may fuel German mobile units and aircraft. Securing their loyalty to the British Empire, and only the British Empire, will be enough of a guarantee of their proper neutrality.\n\nWhatever actions must be taken to preserve this glorious empire will be carried out. If the Germans dare challenge us, we will starve them of their resources!"
 
 ENG_Prepare_for_the_Inevitable:0 "Prepare for the Inevitable"
 ENG_Prepare_for_the_Inevitable_desc:0 "Tensions have been rising throughout the world in recent times, with Europe being the main hotspot. We have attempted to maintain the peace through our diplomatic approach, but as war is becoming an ever likelier prospect, we must awaken to the harsh reality that it simply hasn’t worked. We must now make the necessary preparations, both at home in the Isles and abroad in our imperial holdings to ensure that we can produce enough of the equipment that our armed forces need in time, allowing them to be as prepared as they can be for the battle that is on the horizon."
 
 ENG_Western_Trade_Treaties:0 "Western Trade Allies"
 ENG_Western_Trade_Treaties_desc:0 "One of the immediate effects of the Wall Street Crash was a sharp decline in international commerce. Foreign markets proved unwilling to pay ever-increasing tariffs for foreign goods, and the Atlantic shipping sector ground to a halt. The northern industrial cities of Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, and Bradford- their economies centered on the production of textiles, steel, coal, and ships for export- were particularly devastated by the near-collapse of global trade that followed the 1929 crash.\n\nThe Foreign Office has proposed a series of trade treaties with the United States and France, intended to deepen ties with our old allies and restart the British export economy. Should our prospective partners accept, this could be a critical step toward recovery for all parties."

 ENG_British_Stoicism_desc:0 "The tenets of stoicism- self-control, perseverance, and reason- have long been part of the British spirit, and it was on these virtues that we built our nation and empire.\n\nThe ideal of the British gentleman- educated at Oxford and Cambridge, utterly unflappable and dedicated in his duty to King and country- has percolated through all layers of British society, inspiring them to keep a stiff upper lip.\n\nNo matter what calamity may befall this rainy island, the British people will keep calm and carry on:  for they know no other way."

While the RAF will do everything possible to keep Britain's familiar grey fog from turning green, the Committee of Imperial Defense has already taken steps to protect our people from a successful gas attack on British soil.\n\nThe Air Raid Precautions service will immediately begin distributing gas masks to the civilian population, as well as training specialist teams to decontaminate affected areas. While we pray neither will ever be needed, it is better to be safe than sorry."

 ENG_Pax_Britannica_desc:0 "'War would end if the dead could return'\n\nEver since the last guns fell silent on the French and Belgian fields almost two decades ago the Empire has seen itself in a state of tranquility. While the fires of the revolutions tore Central and Eastern Europe asunder the Empire could happily rest on its laurels knowing that the greatest war mankind had ever seen was over and they were the winners. Perhaps not everything was fine within the Empire itself, the usual Westminster squabbles resonated within the chambers of the Commons and the Lords and from the other sides of the sea the Dominions might cry out.\nBut every man, woman, and child in Britain can rest easy knowing that tomorrow there will be no more bloodshed, and that time will heal the wounds wrought by the past as long as the sun has not yet set on the Empire."
