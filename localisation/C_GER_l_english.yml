 GER_Establish_The_Gestapo_desc:0 "As our Reich consolidates power in the Deutschland, we must remember that radical organizations, from the reactionaries to the communist revolutionaries, all want an end to our newly bred rule. They see our Reich as a living embodiment of what they abhor, and our so-called “warmongering” stance on our foreign policy has allowed our adversaries to invest heavily into these factions, hoping for an end to German revanchism. We cannot and will not allow such activities to hold a single stronghold, regardless whether it be in the most isolated pockets of our territories, to Berlin itself. We must establish a Secret Police, called the Gestapo, to not only deal with adversaries at home but to influence foreign governments abroad, paving the way for a smooth transition of power once we reach their homelands. All shall remember, that the Reich isn’t some pushover that’s easily unstable. On the contrary, our adversaries are everything that they call us…"

 GER_Oberkommando_Putsch_desc:0 "The Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler, has gone too far. We’ve given him a chance to prove his worth, and so far he has exceeded our expectations. However, his pride, stubbornness, and overall stupidity have already affected his leadership, with talks of remilitarizing the Rhineland, an act that will meet overwhelming backlash with the great powers of Europe, eventually bringing us again to another war that will bring the downfall of Germany. We’re still facing the inherent issues created in the aftermath of the First World War, now Hitler intends to bring us into a second one? It is time that we end Hitler’s reign of terror throughout Germany and establish a transitory government that will decide the future of Germany. This coup d’etat will be bloody, and we may face a civil war at our hands, but the so-called thousand-year-old Reich won’t even last a thousand weeks if we bring ourselves into war, regardless if we achieve victory or not."

Governed directly by the Reichsfuhrer-SS, the Reich Main Security Office sole objective is the security of the Reich, both internally and externally. As such, it comprised a variety of tasks, from simple administrative and legal work of the SS, to Foreign Intelligence Services and Suppression of both foreign culture and dissent. Its most infamous child agency, the Gestapo, is highly regarded in its efforts to suppress and purge dissent, “disappearances” of prominent opposition leaders, and the extermination of “undesirables” within the Reich itself."

For too long, the Soviets have been a thorn on our side, countering our ambitions for expansion eastward towards the Baltics and the Balkans. Their ideology of Communism is the epitome of everything we abhor, clinging on such a false truth of liberating the worker, while they themselves are the ones who oppress the common man into their own image. It is time that we bring down our greatest adversary in Europe, and liberate their people from the yolk of Communism once and for all."

The Waffen-SS, unlike the SS Dispositional Troops, are controlled by both the OKW, the Reichsfuhrer-SS, and the Fuhrer himself. They are also comprised of foreign legionnaires, citizens from outside of the Reich’s nominal borders but loyal to our cause. Of course, we only choose the cream of the crop from these foreigners, as the security of the Reich and its cause depends on it. We are, after all, the tip of the spear, the apex of a soldier in the Reich, with its most important leaders, especially our glorious Fuhrer, depending on our success in the battlefield."

 GER_Enforce_Strict_Purity_Requirements_desc:0 "As the horizons and resources of the Waffen-SS expand, so do its prospects for an increase in recruitment. Part of this process has already begun, and there should be nothing wrong with an expansion of the SS. It is not hard to find happy citizens whispering that National Socialism will never meet a finer force of radical Nazis. Except that this may no longer be the case.\n\nMany of the men recruited into the Waffen-SS are not of true Aryan descent. Some are only of Germanic heritage, including foreign volunteers. And of course, they cannot have the same loyalty to the Fatherland as any other of our warriors. As a result, limited spaces in the Waffen-SS are filled up by undesirables from other nations, who likely share no patriotism for the Deutschland.\n\nA new policy must be enforced: We can no longer tolerate these 'unpure' soldiers. From now on, only the ones that match racial purity and physical ability requirements will be allowed to join the prestigious Waffen-SS. This will guarantee their place as a fanatical fighting force, a beacon of true German pride for all others to admire!"

 GER_SS_Panzer_Units_desc:0 "The Waffen-SS has proved its prowess on the battlefield due to the highly resilient nature of these elite troops. Now, the evolving nature of warfare in Europe insists that we begin a transition into Panzergrenadier and Panzer divisions.\n\nThere is no question of whether our SS men deserve this upgrade. There are no soldiers finer both in their fighting ability and fanaticism than those of the Waffen-SS. Should this proposal be carried out, several SS divisions will be redirected to the homeland and temporarily relieved of active duty until the new mobile units have been fully reorganised.\n\nUpgrading existing units and recruiting new ones will be a tremendous drain of our current stockpile and production capacity. Even assembling a quarter of the divisions that the SS plans to raise will prove difficult. It is an expensive decision, one that must ultimately be made by the Führer.\n\nIf he does decide to allow the changes, it will be the best choice for the Reich. The Waffen-SS will serve us with all the effort they can muster!"

 GER_SS_Elite_Units:0 "SS-Spezialkräfte"
 GER_SS_Elite_Units_desc:0 "The troops of the Waffen-SS are of the “purest” stock, each Aryan a complete fighting unit in his own right. It only makes sense to isolate the cream of the crop to form our Special forces, acclimatized in all terrains, ready for all manners of operations, be it aerial assaults or amphibious operations, the SS troops seem to be the most appropriate and fit for such physically taxing and difficult tasks. With the necessary approval from the party apparatus, it has been decided to aggressively expand the naval troop training establishment in Swinemünde and to adapt Luftwaffe Fallschirmschule Nr. 3 to accommodate personnel and train them to the highest standards, to form elite Marinestoßtruppen and Fallschirmjäger units of the Waffen-SS."

 GER_Divisionen_der_SS_desc:0 "These are desperate times, times that will test the European civilization, failure will result in decadent Bolsheviks taking over, while we have much to gain, we have everything to lose. In his latest directive the Reichsführer der SS has approved the recruitment of combat personnel from foreign territories, particularly from the eastern ones, with many from a questionable racial profile to say the very least. Despite protests from some of the more traditionalists of the SS, many understand the need for all the manpower we can get to face the Bolshevik “hordes”, to dissuade fears that these new personnel will be part of the SS, they will serve in Divisions, which are simply under the disposition of the Waffen-SS, rather than Waffen-SS Divisions."

 GER_Recruit_from_the_Wehrmacht:0 "Recruit from the Wehrmacht"
 GER_Recruit_from_the_Wehrmacht_desc:0 "Focus within the Waffen-SS has turned to the maintenance of its high standards in recruitment. The search for worthy new members is becoming more difficult, simply because the most patriotic of our fighters are already serving in the Waffen-SS. The SS leadership turns to the Führer himself with a contentious request: they wish for permission to turn to the army and pick out the apex of their warriors. It makes sense if the SS is to remain the elite of the elite.\n\nThe biggest objection to this request comes from Oberkommando Wehrmacht, who were outspoken several times during the establishment Waffen-SS. OKW alread seethes with frustration, and continuing to anger them by giving priority to the SS divisions may just be lighting up their fury. We can be certain that whatever side we appease, the other will react extremely negatively.\n\nIt is time to address this proposal formally and negotiate a compromise between the two factions. It certainly makes sense to give the SS a larger manpower pool, but OKW refuses to allow it. The Führer's judgement will be the decisive factor."

 GER_SS_Freiwillige_Divisions:0 "SS-Freiwilligen-Divisionen"
 GER_SS_Freiwillige_Divisions_desc:0 "Despite the National Socialist ideology putting the Germans above all others, we are not against any other race that isn't a detriment to the world - nor are we going to deny extra manpower in our armies. There are hundreds of thousands of men in other countries willing to fight for the National Socialist cause; to fight for the truth of the world above all else, rejecting the falsehoods of the modern world with force. We could take advantage of this by launching SS recruitment campaigns in our occupied territories, allowing us to set up SS-Freiwilligen Divisionen - SS Volunteer Divisions, that serve in the name of their respective lands, fighting for and protecting them through serving in the German Army. We are confident that the spirit of any true National Socialist is as strong as any other - and even if that isn't the case, an elite soldier is an elite soldier - still an asset worth having in the SS."

 GER_Heer:0 "The Heer"
 GER_Heer_desc:0 "With the rearmament going faster than even we had anticipated, we must now decide which direction the new Wehrmacht should take. Should we build and improve upon what we learned during the Welkrieg? Could our successes in the Kaiserschlacht maybe be our prime indicator of how we should fight in modern war? Or should we listen to the new ideas of Generals Guderian and Lutz, who think that the Panzer is the future and the key to revolutionizing modern warfare, emphasizing speed and mobility."

 GER_Achtung_Panzer:0 "Achtung - Panzer!"
 GER_Achtung_Panzer_desc:0 "German warfare has always been based around speed and mobility, quick wars and decisive victories. The Weltkrieg’s crippling trench warfare impaired our army and the German fighting spirit, but with new cutting-edge technologies such as better and faster Panzers and improved radios and with tactical pioneers such as Heinz Guderian and Erwin Rommel leading the helm, we finally have what we need to break through the trenches. We shall revolutionize modern warfare in a way that will see our enemies completely overwhelmed."

 GER_Panzerjager:0 "Panzerjäger"
 GER_Panzerjager_desc:0 "Our enemies have begun mastering the art of armored warfare, along with producing more advanced types of armored tanks. As such, it places us in a difficult position to continue our Blitzkrieg throughout Europe and beyond. As such, we must learn to not only counter their newly created tanks, but reduce them to scrap metal. Henceforth, the Wehrmacht will be ordered to create a new branch of service overseen by the Heer, the Panzerjager. Translated as “Armor-Hunters”, the Panzerjager will be the anti-armored arm of our glorious armed forces. The general design will be that an anti-tank weapon will be mounted along with a weapon shield on a tracked chassis, enabling it to deal maximum penetration while ensuring high mobility."

 GER_Panzergrenadiers:0 "Panzergrenadiers"
 GER_Panzergrenadiers_desc:0 "Bewegungskrieg is the center of our doctrine, the pinnacle of German strategy. However, tanks alone cannot break the front line. Our mobile force needs infantry to accompany them to secure sectors, defend the flanks and provide support. Recently, one of our generals has come up with an idea of how do deal with this. He says we should mechanize some of our troops, to allow them to keep up with the tanks, yet pack the same punch. He says we would call them Panzergrenadiers, and they would be an elite force of men. This idea has gathered support, and many are calling on us to agree."

 GER_Mannschaftstransportwagen:0 "Mannschaftstransportwagen"
 GER_Mannschaftstransportwagen_desc:0 "Modern war with its ever more devastating weapons is becoming hugely dangerous for infantry. Shrapnel, mines, artillery fire, not even our Panzergrenadiere can provide enough protection for our infantry anymore. This is why we have developed the first fully-tracked infantry vehicle of the Wehrmacht, the Kätzchen. Unlike the Panzergrenadiere, it will be fully on tracks and will have armour similar to that of a tank, almost looking like one and only missing the turret. With this newly enforced infantry-vehicle, we will be able to more effectively ensure the safe arrival of our infantry at the front lines and will make our assault even more powerful."

 GER_Entwicklung_Series:0 "Entwicklung Series"
 GER_Entwicklung_Series_desc:0 "While our medium and heavy Panzers are some of the if not the best tanks in the world, it is becoming apparent that they’re not ideal. Slowly but surely their deficits are becoming clearer, yet the problem does not lie in the model, but in the concept: through the course of the war and the development of modern warfare, the concept of light, medium and heavy tanks has become more and more outdated, which is why we have tasked our engineers to reinvent the modern tank and they gave us the Entwicklung Series or E-Serie. These Panzers, of which the first model will be the E-50, will be new standardized tanks, which means that every Panzer of the E-Serie will have interchangeable parts, so they can be repaired and built more easily, which will greatly increase their reliability and production efficiency and thus will be better adapted to modern warfare and the challenges it brings. They will serve as the main Panzers of the entire army. Our enemies might think that we will just rest on the loreals of our past achievements and innovations, but once the E-Serie rolls over their troops they will know just how wrong they were."

 GER_Kriegsmarine:0 "The Kriegsmarine"
 GER_Kriegsmarine_desc:0 "Over twenty years ago the German fleet was the pride of our nation: We had the biggest and strongest ships and an expansive home and colonial fleet that was able to pose a real danger to the Royal Navy. But, due to our losses in the Weltkrieg and the crippling treaty of Versailles, our fleet is a far cry from what it used to be. It’s time to change that: Since the rearmament began our fleet has been growing steadily as well, but the real expansion of the Kriegsmarine has just begun. Many of our admirals such as Erich Raeder dream of a grand German armada, one day eclipsing established fleets such as the Royal or US Navy, while others such as Karl Dönitz think more practical and want to work and improve on what we have, leaving wild dreams and future plans for tomorrow. Choosing one of these paths will be crucial but building up our fleet will be no easy task and will take a lot of time and resources. In the end, though, we will have what we once used to and go even beyond that and make the Kriegsmarine the greatest fleet in the world."

 GER_Unterseeboot:0 "U-Boot"
 GER_Unterseeboot_desc:0 "Admiral Karl Dönitz has requested the production of 300 submarines, a quite unreasonable request at first glance but upon hearing Dönitz’ plans and ideas, focusing on the U-Boot seems like probably the best choice: The Kriegsmarine is still young and low on numbers, meanwhile building capital ships is quite expensive and time-consuming. Not so with submarines. They are relatively fast to build and low on cost. In contrast, their tactical and strategic potential is astonishing: Admiral Dönitz has noted that many of our enemy’s fleets, especially the Royal Navy, lack submarines and are not prepared for facing a large amount of them, meaning that using them to sink their convoys will be quite easy and with a large enough amount even their large capital ship fleets will be hugely endangered. Our enemies think that their capital ships are unbeatable and their fleets are decades ahead of the Kriegsmarine, but they will have a shrewd awakening once facing our grand U-Boot armada and realize that their hubris will lead to their doom."

 GER_Schwerer_Kreuzer:0 "Schwerer Kreuzer"
 GER_Schwerer_Kreuzer_desc:0 "The Treaty of Versaille restricts our navy to the point that we can’t build ships exceeding 10.000 tons to replace our outdated battleships. This badly cripples our ability to combat the +35,000 ton vessels our rivals are building. The idea of a “Panzerschiffe” or heavily armed cruiser seeks to solve this problem. These ships hold guns large enough to fight battleships, while still keeping their weight below the tonnage limit. While especially the armor of these ships suffers from all the weight the guns are taking up, as long as we are restricted to this tonnage these ships will be our best shot at combating our rivals naval power."

 GER_Seek_a_Naval_Agreement_with_Britain_desc:0 "The Kriegsmarine has expanded at a rate unmatched by any navy in the world. Our tonnage has increased dramatically throughout the years. However, if we continue on our path, the British will take notice of the naval expansion. Therefore, a treaty with Britain to renegotiate our allowed tonnage must be put at the forefront of our diplomatic agenda.\nWhilst the British may have the most amount of capital ships in the world, they have informed us that if we continue on our rapid naval program, any attempt to renegotiate any such naval treaty will fall on deaf ears. As such, we must make concessions at the conference to the Royal Navy, but judging by the weak facade that the British government props up about ‘holding back the Germans from European domination’, our demands will easily be forced through.

No longer, shall we be just the masters of the land, we shall be the masters of the sea. As such, our great thinkers in the Oberkommando der Marine have devised a plan known as “[ROOT.GetFocusName_GER_Plan_Z]”, the aggressive rearmament of our Kriegsmarine. A strict quota of ships from varying classes, from destroyers to battleships alike, will be established and if followed diligently, the world’s navies shall sink to the bottom of the sea, for the Kriegsmarine shall sail the oceans of the Earth, with nothing standing in its way."

 GER_UBoot_Cruisers_desc:0 "Until now our U-Boot were forced to stay close to our ports and their effectiveness in attacking enemy convoys was thus decreased. This is why we will bring a submarine type from the Weltkrieg back to life: The U-Kreuzer. Essentially a U-Boot but much bigger, with heavier guns and with even greater range. With the U-Kreuzer, we can attack trading fleets as far away as the mid-Atlantic and cut off our enemy’s supply lines where they’re the weakest. The new U-Kreuzers will be the height of German ship-engineering and be a powerful addition to our already mighty submarine fleet."
 
 GER_Elektroboot:0 "Elektroboot"
 GER_Elektroboot_desc:0 "Cutting the life supply of the Allies in the Atlantic requires new sophisticated technology to combat the material superiority of the Allies in the sea. A revolutionary upgrade of our effective submarine weapon could give us the decisive edge to strangle the Allied supply lines. The Elektroboot project consists of a submarine capable of operating submerged in its entirety, rather than just to escape detection or launch an attack. Running on a mix of hydrogen peroxide and diesel engines to recharge the batteries, this new submarine is designed to work submerged underwater for extended periods. Featuring snorkel and an updated automatized weapon system, the Elektroboot will guarantee an absolute control of the ocean."

 GER_Flugzeugtrager_desc:0 "The premier navies of the world, such as the Royal Navy or the Imperial Japanese Navy, utilize aircraft carriers to further spread their influence across the seas. Many in the Kriegsmarine believe that such a carrier is necessary. \n\nHowever many others, such as Herr Goering himself and the Luftwaffe, are not fond of the idea that the navy is given more access to researching into carrier-based fighters and bombers, as they believe that a pilot should always be from the Luftwaffe, and not any other service branch. Other such problems are our extreme inexperience in building such carriers, and the large clique of battleship admirals who demand that they are given precedence. Nevertheless, we shall push on with our research and development into what could become the key to our navy's supremacy. \n\nWir dienen Deutschland!"

Its size, range and power have reached an almost mythical level, rivalling or maybe even surpassing that of the Royal Navy in its prime. This advantage allows us to implement the Präsenzflotte-doctrine. A fleet strategy which follows the ideas of the great war philosopher Sun Tsu, because with this approach we will win without a fight. Our ships will rarely leave their ports and only attack enemy fleets when they have overwhelming superiority and are guaranteed to win without sustaining notable damage. The presence of our fleet is enough to gain naval superiority, as the mere potential of our ships engaging the enemy suffices to make it not worth it for them to even attempt to enter our waters. The top priority of the Kriegsmarine will henceforth be preserving and expanding our own fleet instead of fighting that of our foes. "

 GER_Zukunftsflotte:0 "Zukunft der Kriegsmarine"
 GER_Zukunftsflotte_desc:0 "The first expansion of our fleet was a resounding success and we have learned many things throughout the many battles our ships have fought. It is now time to further expand the Kriegsmarine and build it up from a low-priority part of our nation to what it once was, to the pride of Germany. The Kriegsmarine shall become the mightiest fleet in the world and be as feared by sailors as a typhoon in September.

 GER_Baltische_Flotte_desc:0 "Instead of venturing out to the Atlantic, a far away ocean controlled by some of the greatest naval powers in the world, we shall focus on a sea that is close to us, has historically been sailed by Germans and has no noteworthy naval power near it. The Baltic sea is surrounded by weak nations and even weaker navies, things that are both estrange to us. Controlling it is of utmost importance for us and will keep resources from Scandinavia flooding in, hence why we must focus on ships best suited for it. We shall focus on destroyers and submarines in order to build a powerful Baltic fleet and make the Baltic sea an impenetrable German fortress."

 GER_Atlantische_Flotte:0 "Atlantikflotte"
 GER_Atlantische_Flotte_desc:0 "If we want to be recognized as a world power, we can’t keep playing in puddles like the Baltic sea and building fishing boats. No, we must set out to the Atlantic Ocean and we must conquer it in the name of the Führer and in the name of the Reich, so that no blockade and no foreign navies will ever threaten our people again. For that we will have to build a bigger fleet and not just larger in size, but we will need bigger, heavier and more destructive ships. Submarines are for cowards and destroyers are cannon fodder, what we need are ships that will make our enemies tremble before the Kriegsmarine and that will make them afraid of even the thought of facing us in battle. Cruisers, battleships and carries must be the future of the Kriegsmarine."

 GER_Luftwaffe:0 "The Luftwaffe"
 GER_Luftwaffe_desc:0 "While air warfare was not that important in the Weltkrieg, with new plane models growing bigger and deadlier every year, all evidence suggests that it will play a crucial role in the wars to come. This is why a reorganization of our young albeit rapidly growing air force, the Luftwaffe, is solely needed. Until now the main focus was to build up a sizable air force without following a certain direction. But now, since it has reached a respectable size and war is approaching, greater and bolder steps must be taken. We must begin to build aircraft more efficiently and with more aim. Only with a well-organized and battle-ready Luftwaffe will we have what it takes to gain dominance in the skies."

 GER_Luftlandetruppen:0 "Luftlandetruppen"
 GER_Luftlandetruppen_desc:0 "With our Fallschirmjäger, we already laid the grounds for what paratroopers can achieve in modern war. Throughout the war they have proven to be quite effective, the things that hinder their success are usually their low equipment and their lack of motorization or armoured vehicles. Our new Luftlandetruppen will eliminate that weakness: With our large and improved transport planes and our sophisticated para shoots, we are now able to not only para drop soldiers but also vehicles and artillery. Essentially, we are able to drop entire armies out of the sky. This is a strategic advantage of massive scale, one that could change the course of the war. No longer will our troops be confined to the land, our enemies will have one direction more to deal with, as our armies won’t just come from the front, rear, left and right, but also from above."

Our enemies tremble even at the thought of facing us in the field, so it’s only logical that we should put all our resources into strengthening it even more, into making it truly unstoppable. That is why the Luftwaffe shall focus its efforts on the development of ground support doctrines and assist the Wehrmacht in every step of its way as it cuts through our enemies’ forces. The fact that the Hermann Göring, one of the most trusted friends of our Führer and head of the Luftwaffe, is also a big proponent of this plan makes this course of action even more obvious."

Our technology and scientific expertise is rivaled by no one in the entire world: All the British and Americans have are Jewish refugees, born and raised here in the Vaterland. But we don’t need them, in fact we’re better off without them. And we shall proof this once and for all here and now in this war. The weapons we shall build will be the greatest culmination of innovative genius and scientific expertise in world history. Panzers, heavier and more powerful than anything our enemies could ever hope to build, while still maintaining an astonishing amount of speed, great and devastating rockets that will traverse entire continents to strike our enemies where they’ll never see it coming and warplanes propelled by jet engines surpassing the speed of sound – With these tools of destruction we shall crush our enemies and defeat them in a manner more absolute and unadulterated than anything ever seen before in the history of war."

The greatest physicists in Germany, Werner Heisenberg, Robert Döpel, Kurt Diebner and Paul Karteck, came together to find a use for nuclear technology that will benefit the Reich and the war. What they found is that using nuclear fission a bomb can be created that far eclipses all weapons ever built, ever imagined by man. This weapon, the Atombombe will have the power to wipe out entire cities in a few moments and make them inhospitable for decades to come. But we’re not the only ones with this knowledge, we know that the cursed Jews that have fled the Reich are researching the same weapon at this very moment somewhere abroad. A weapon such as this cannot fall into the false hands of our rotten and inferior enemies, it must be realized by us first.

Fighters have always been the backbone of any air force and equipping our fighters with jet engines will give us an important edge in air battles and would probably see greater damage to the enemy air force. On the other hand, we could leave that for later and focus more on the Ar 234 initially. Tactical bombers are the by far most versatile planes in our arsenal. They can support ground troops, attack enemy ships and because of their large range can even go on strategic bombing missions. Building more of these initially would make sure that our jets are getting use in almost all areas and that their benefit is felt on every battlefield."

With his invention we can develop warplanes unlike the world has ever seen, planes that will come close to the speed of sound and that will strike fear into the hearts of our enemies.

We will remind our enemies that the Luftwaffe rules all the skies, even those atop the sea, and we shall do that by building aircraft specially designed to attack their ships.

This new air force will focus only on naval aircraft and will ensure that all demands made by the Kriegsmarine are fulfilled, while our regular Luftwaffe can focus on supporting our armies and raiding our enemies.

Eager to finally do something she immediately jumped up and began fumbling around the kitchen almost forgetting how to perform these simple tasks, while almost dropping the tray on her way out of the kitchen.  When she entered the meeting room, she immediately noticed the tense atmosphere and tension that loomed in the room, even though both von Papen and Hitler immediately dropped their conversation to await their beverages, looking at her with impatience, waiting to resume their verbal battle. She quickly set down the tray and almost sprinted out of the room, eager to escape this nightmare of a meeting and again began to await orders in the servants' kitchen.  \n\nAfter almost two hours of nothing curiosity and a hint of boredom overcame her and she pressed her ear to the door in order to learn something about this curious meeting and while she only heard a fraction of the conversation regarding minister positions, the head of government and Hindenburg amongst other things, she only began realizing what was just discussed, when the terms “joint government“ and “Reichskanzler Hitler“, were uttered followed by the sound of what appeared to be a handshake.

It wasn´t the first time the has been forced to wait in his political career but it was the first time someone has done this to send a message to him.  “Don´t try again, you lost.“ But despite the countless hours of discussion, the argument against the seemingly impossibly stubborn mind of the old General, he hadn't given up on his proposal. He had to try once more to convince him. \n\nSchleicher entered his office. Slumped into his chair with baggy eyes, a shaking hand and an ashtray that overflowed, it seemed that the wise old man with the determined eyes and sure voice he knew before had aged 20 years in just a year. Schleicher pitied him, but he had no choice but to deny the old man his rest. “Reichskanzler, I hope that the time you had to ponder convinced you that my proposal is the only way to prevent Germany from destroying itself. An intelligent man like you truly must understand the need for these, I admit, rather dramatic measures.“ Hindenburg's brow furrowed. “No. Schleicher, you can´t just declare a state of emergency and hope that the Nazis and Communists just... accept it.“ Schleicher responded immediately with anger. “So what else should we do? Do nothing and twiddle our thumbs, waiting, until all this - the economic crisis, the Nazis, the communists just - disappear!? You can´t be serious... What do you want to do?“ \n\nA moment of silence filled the room. The tired eyes of the old man betrayed his intentions. Schleicher resumed his shouting match immediately. “You can´t be serious! You really think listening to Von Papen will do you any good? What has gotten into you?" “Enough of this!“ The old man nearly jumped from his seat and just for a moment it seemed his spirit had returned, but then he fell back into his chair - drained of life once more. “I won´t approve your proposal, Herr von Schleicher. It would be this Republic's undoing. Now get out.”"

He has justified this by saying that 'it is the only way to save the Republic from the forces that wish to end it.'\n\nThe Reichskanzler has never been outwardly against the idea of emergency powers coming into play, as repeated meetings have shown - however, it had been doubted that he would ever attempt to force this through. However, the threat of Zentrum being voted out of their seats and the coalition falling apart in the coming elections may have forced his hand into play, and the consequences have been dire.\n\nThe SPD, KPD, and liberal parties have all spoken out in disgust against the motion set forth by Schleicher. Making up a majority in the Reichstag, these parties would have been able to put down the vote if it happened. Schleicher immediately withdrew his proposal, drawing the ire of the DNVP and NSDAP as a 'spineless coward' not willing to do what must be done. Needless to say, Schleicher's position is hopeless and his reputation is - if it wasn't before - shattered."

His coercing of Hindenburg into acting on emergency decrees alone has put the already fragile state of democracy in the Republic into a crisis for the last four years, with government after government unable to create a true majority coalition.\n\nA few days ago, von Schleicher requested the dissolution of the current Reichstag government - which the Reichspräsident von Hindenburg denied emphatically, citing the instability that would be caused if such an action was undertaken. With a no-confidence vote in Schleicher's government bound to be successful on the reconvening of the Reichstag and his reputation as the 'destroyer of governments' finally coming back to haunt him, von Schleicher has resigned his position as Reichskanzler effective immediately.\n\nSources say that he is planning to support the potential Chancellorship of one Adolf Hitler of the NSDAP in order to prevent his own political rival Von Papen from receiving said position. Schleicher's political maneuvers are certainly not dead, but Germany is free of a career strongman in charge for now.\n\nNo one knows what the future will bring now, but Germany looks upon the sunrise with hope in its heart."

 DH_GER_POL_NAP.1.d:0 "Today the German ambassador Hans-Adolf von Moltke presented several documents outlining a non-aggression pact between the German Reich and the Polish Republic to Marshal Josef Pilsudski. The non-aggression pact would guarantee that both countries will only resolve to bilateral negotiations, while both sides will abstain from any military actions against one another for the next ten years. Furthermore, if we sign the pact Germany will declare itself willing to recognize the new Polish borders, established in 1919 after the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, while also confirming Danzig's status as a free city. Pilsudski seems to be in favor of the agreement due to the expected French defensive war doctrine and the possibility of gaining a partner against the Soviet Union. However, there are still voices inside the government that advises against the pact, since it would most likely anger France, damaging the relations with our close military and trade partner."

The pact also guarantees to Poland that we will accept the new eastern border, established by the Novemberverräter in 1919, while also confirming Danzigs status as a free city.

At the same time, she announced her willingness to 'destroy her last machine gun' and 'demobilize her last soldier' if other nations would do likewise.\n\nA period of back and forth in the latest meeting of LoN delegates had ensued, with Germany refusing to slow down its rearmament until Poland or France disarmed themselves. Each time, the notion was refused - and it seemed that the meeting would reach a boiling point. That it did - with the German delegation announcing the exit of the German nation from the League of Nations, citing protest over other nations' constant maintaining of the humiliating treaties inflicted upon the German nation following the Great War that still continues to this day while being unwilling to follow their own peacekeeping principles.\n\nIn line with the temperate tone of all the German pronouncements, officials made it plain to the press that they planned to leave the league smoothly and in a friendly manner, as righteous protestors and not as rebels.

 DH_GER_LoN.2.t:0 "Germany Repudiates the Locarno Treaty"
 DH_GER_LoN.2.d1:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]It is clear the time of German cooperation with the West is over. Signed in 1925, and one of the major achievements of the Weimar government under the progressive reforms of Gustav Stresemann, the Treaty of Locarno represented the beginning of an internationalist mindset within Germany. Though the scars of the Great war were still deep, the Treaty paved the way for reconciliation between France and Germany as well as a part of the greater struggle for global peace. No longer would the Germans claim French land, and in return, they were allowed membership into the League of Nations. With the rise of Hitler and the Third Reich, as well as the worrying rearmament taking place under the Nazis, the future of the relationships between the West and the Germans is uncertain. Claiming it was in justified response to the Franco-Soviet Alliance, the Germans have recently re-entered the demilitarized Rhineland with their soldiers. Although the moral validity of this action is questionable at the least, no response was deemed necessary, further than condemnation. Hitler has taken this as an opportunity for a full repudiation of the Locarno Treaties, an obvious sign of his war-mongering ambitions in the West. With this destruction of the Treaty, he has reasserted his claims on many Western territories, including those in Alsace-Lorraine and Eupen-Malmedy."
 DH_GER_LoN.2.d2:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The 1925 Treaty of Locarno stands as an obvious nuisance in the German plans for asserting her European dominance. Agreed upon under in the influence of Gustav Stresemann in the time of the dysfunctional Weimar government, the treaties assured that Germany accepted the Western territorial concessions. The signing of the treaties placated the French, as they now considered the threat of German invasion to be neutralized. But now the time of the Weimar Republic is over, as the New Third Reich is stamping their mark on the history of central Europe. The Franco-Soviet alliance of 1935 is a clear violation of the Locarno Treaty, no longer shall Germany stand idle whilst the Western powers rest on the laurels of Versailles. The justified response of the Germans, through the remilitarization of the Rhineland, was met with no opposition, other than meaningless condemnation. This display of spinelessness by the British and the French paves the way for further development on Hitler’s ambitions in the West, as the Reich reasserts its Western claims on previously German lands, such as those in Alsace-Lorraine and Eupen-Malmedy. It seems a Western war is imminent…"
 DH_GER_LoN.2.d3:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The Locarno Treaties were put in place in 1925, under the influence of Gustav Stresemann, to ensure that the new Weimar Government would not lay claim to any previously German territories, conceded to the allies in the Treaty of Versailles. Although the signing of the treaty was representative of a new, internationalist mindset developing in the major powers of Europe, the idealistic dreams of world peace seem to be collapsing. With the ascension of the National Socialists, Germany seems to be increasingly restless and the prospect of another European centered conflict, on a similar scale to the last, is becoming ever more realistic. The case of an increasingly aggressive Germany seems to be worrying the French and the British and precautions have already begun to be taken. The Franco-Soviet Alliance was signed in 1935 in order to deter Hitler from expanding too far, either East or West, at the risk of a war on two fronts, a factor playing a major part in the downfall of the German Empire in the First War. The German’s responded opportunistically to this shortly afterward, taking advantage of the Western power’s preoccupation in the Abyssinian crisis through the reoccupation of the Rhineland, demilitarised since the Treaty of Versailles. Now the Nazis have taken their Western ambitions a step further in a total repudiation of the Locarno Treaties as well as reasserting their claims over German influenced Western territories, such as those in Alsace-Lorraine and Eupen-Malmedy. Goodness knows what lies ahead in the Future of Europe."

 DH_GER_Rhineland.1.d:0 "When the meeting was finally nearing its end, it felt like he had already spent an eternity in this small coffin of a meeting room together with the other two unfortunate souls who had to play their part in perhaps the biggest gamble of German history. They both had argued against this step for hours citing military statistics, graphs, maps, everything but in the end, it seemed that they understood that their advice was spoken into the wind. Nevertheless, they mounted on the final attack, one last hopeless attempt to subvert the coming catastrophe or at least keep their hands clean.\n“With all due respect, I can only repeat myself, marching into the Rhineland in our current position is almost hopeless. Our military is weak and the French know this. They would just move in and occupy the Rhineland again, this time for good. No treaties, diplomatic negotiations, or demilitarization. Just occupation and perhaps even annexation. It is just a risk we can´t take. We must either wait and build up our forces even more or we could always try to negotiate a remilitarization.“\n“I agree. We should at least try to negotiate, before provoking the French in such a bold-“\n“Meine Herren, I appreciate your concern, but we all know that the French won´t even try to reach an agreement with us. The future belongs to those who seize it and I have no intention of sitting in Berlin, doing nothing, while the world overtakes us. The Rhineland must be remilitarized and Germany must fulfill its destiny, no matter the concerns. Blomberg?“\n“Yes?“\n“How long would it take to move the units you mentioned into the Rheinland?“\n“Around 3 days.“\n“Good. Prepare the men to march. Fritsch?“\n“Yes?“\n“You will help Reichswehrminister Blomberg in any way you can. Is that clear?“\n“Yes...but mein Führer what will we do when the French cross the border?“\n“We will retreat.

Currently, the French government has been making overtures to the Judeo-Bolshevik tyrants of the Soviet Union as evident by the Franco-Soviet pact of 1935.  \n\nThis is clearly an effort to prepare for an invasion of the Fatherland that will result in its ultimate destruction if not stopped.

No doubt with aggressive intentions, to be expected with Adolf Hitler’s rhetoric. Using the Franco-Soviet Pact as justification for the repudiation of Locarno, they have met little resistance internationally. Hitler has offered to rejoin the League of Nations and sign a non-aggression pact with us on the condition that we accept the remilitarization. \nBut why should we take the word of a man who has already broken it? Though they couldn’t have picked a worse time for us, especially with recent instability, the unpopularity of mobilizing the army, our economic downturn and elections soon, we couldn’t afford even the lightest intervention especially if the troop estimates of General Gamelin are correct. The fact that the Franc has been radically devalued as of late, means we couldn’t afford a single day of mobilization much less an entire war as it is looking like it might shape up to be if we were to actually intervene and even then we would still feel the aftershocks of our mobilization if they backed down."

As such, he has created a “call to arms” for all the people of Austria, to rise up and topple their authoritarian regime which cowardly hides under the guise of “democracy” and “republicanism”.

What immediate use would a holiday have? It would all be over in just two weeks and he never had any interest in visiting foreign places, so in the end, the money would be wasted and he gained nothing from it.\n\nBut when he saw the Poster reading „Holiday on board the Der Deutsche. Hamburg-Neapel-Palmero-Bari-Venice. 2,50RM per day per Person.“ he suddenly yearned for sun and relaxation. He had some concern about the price since it was still a large amount of money, but with the companies reopening in the city and his increase in income, it was well within the possible. His children were either grown up and Anton his youngest spend most of his time in school and in the Hitler youth anyways. The farm would certainly survive for two weeks without him. So, during mass, he pondered. Why not? Surely he and his wife deserved it and it would be a nice sign for her, showing her that the poverty and turmoil of the Weimar years were over.\n\nSo the next Friday he made a small detour during his usual deliveries to the city, going to the local KdF-office and buying 2 tickets, hoping that his wife would be as thrilled as he was.

And so the two of them would go on Holiday for the first time in their life. \n\nNow three months he laid beside his wife on the beach, smiling to himself and thanking his past self for taking the time to read the poster on his way to church.

The middle east now watches, waiting for Britain's next move. It has not been the first time since a revolt against mandates set up by London has happened, and it might also not be the last. "

As a prevention method, the practice of burning houses suspected to be 'meeting places' for partisan activity has been put forth. As the war continues and grows, it has become a certainty that the fight against resistance forces will be one of the most important struggles to be dealt by the Reich's intelligence, police and military forces alike."

Upon delivery, they were sent to an 'SS Office of Financial Affairs', which was supposed to pay them, but instead forwarded them further to an 'SS Office for Economic Cooperation', where they were told that the original office was supposed to pay them directly.\n\nPerhaps even more disturbing are the materials ordered - precision machinery, large amounts of chemicals used to make fertilizer as well as quantities of steel and sheet metal.\n\nHimmler has refused to discuss these events with government officials, but was overheard talking to a high-ranking SS liaison officer in the Ministry of Economic Affairs, saying that 'if [GER.GetLeader] won't give me guns, I will just have to build my own. I don't care where or how I get what I need for that.'"

Over dozens of pages, it details how the SS could use its diminished but still substantial powers to seize control over the government 'in the event that [GER.GetLeader] betrays the national-socialist cause'. Evidence for such a betrayal, the paper continues, would be a lack of commitment to replacing existing obsolete organisations such as the Army with new formations built in the right national-socialist character.\n\nThe memo bears the signature of Heinrich Himmler."

Clearly overtaken by his lust for power, the Reichsführer SS tried to kill [GER.GetLeader], but the gun jammed and didn't fire. In the moment of confusion, the Führer managed to overpower Himmler and shout for help. Reportedly, it took four members of his guard detail to restrain Himmler.\n\nElsewhere in the Reich, a number of tense standoffs between SS and regular Army units ensued as the former attempted to seize key communication posts but eventually withdrew after hearing that [GER.GetLeader] had survived.\n\nWehrmacht units have the main SS offices and holdings surrounded and are awaiting orders from Berlin."

According to his testimony, the Führer, clearly gripped by madness, had declared him a complete failure of a man and a soldier, a traitor and a spy to be shot at dawn. Realizing that he must choose between his personal honor and the survival of the nation, Himmler decided to act immediately and shot him. In the aftermath, members of the Führer's guard detail attempted to kill Himmler as an assassin. Only the timely arrival of Himmler's own bodyguards saved the Reichsführer SS.\n\n Across Germany, the news of the death of the Führer has evidently served as a signal to put long-prepared into action. Both SS and regular Army units raced to secure bridges, telephone exchanges and crossroads, with Luftwaffe paratroopers rapidly mobilizing to seize airfields all across the Reich.\n\nGermany stands at the edge of a civil war, and all three factions will rely on the civilian government to actually run the country."

How could one negotiate with men that consider him less than human?\n\nAs Molotov stepped out onto the platform, the leader of the German team stepped forward, making a short remark in his mother tongue. Molotov's translator took an uncomfortably long moment to exchange the German words for Russian ones and then turned back to the Soviets.\n\n“Welcome to Berlin, Mr. Molotov.”\n\nA smile spread across the German's face, and he held out an eagle-cuffed right hand.

The port at Sevastopol, located on the Crimean Peninsula in the Black Sea, could serve this purpose- if it weren't for the narrows at the Bosporus and Dardanelles commanding entry into the Mediterranean. \n\nShould the Soviet Union take control of these straits, either directly or by adding Turkey to their sphere of influence, the Bolsheviks will have achieved something no previous Russian government had managed to do- establish Russia as a credible naval power.\n\nAs part of our negotiations with the Soviet Union, the Soviet delegation has come to us demanding that they should be allowed to take control of the straits. \n\nWhile this would allow the Soviets to challenge the British in the eastern Mediterranean, it would certainly enrage the Italians, who have their territorial designs in the region. Finally, many within the party are opposed to any Soviet territorial expansion whatsoever, especially one with such far-reaching implications.\n\nControl of the straits is no doubt the Soviet delegation's highest priority- should we deny them this, they will most likely break off negotiations entirely."

In return, Germany and the Soviet Union would issue a joint guarantee for Bulgaria to prevent any further loss of territory. \n\nWhile Bulgaria holds only minor strategic utility for us, it may prove wise in the long term to deny the Soviets this request. Growing closer to one Balkan nation will certainly antagonize its neighbors, and with the addition of Italian interests in the area, Bulgaria may prove more trouble than it's worth. \n\nOn the other hand, continued cooperation with the Soviet Union could prove extremely valuable going forward, and Bulgaria may be a small price to pay."

However, they are willing to grant us a compromise; docking rights at Bulgarian ports.

They have forced our hand, and now we must let go of our Romanian aspirations.\n\nMolotov has reported back, saying that whilst we may have lost Romania that is not reason enough to leave the conference, as this means the Germans will have to give somewhere else. He urges General Secretary Stalin not to cancel the talks, for we may still consolidate gains elsewhere.

As our delegation has pointed out to Hitler, there is no real way we can rebuff these claims and order the Soviets to stand down, as we have no contacts or influence in these countries anyway.\n\nAs it stands now, we have to accept the Soviet demands on these territories, for better or worse.

This not-so-subtle mention that the Southern States are private property waiting to be redistributed by us is an extremely helpful one, as it ensures that the Germans won't question our stranglehold on the region if we choose to exert ourselves.\n\nThis raises an opportunity, whether to accept the German offer and grow even more powerful as a nation, or decline and be seen as weak.

However, once it was all united? A new dawn for his nation, and for the world indeed. The man opposite him looked upon the rows and rows of paper. He took out a pen and put his signature on the dotted line. \n\nThen the charters were given to him. The man who has been crowned by Stalin as his nation's greatest threat offered his pen. He smiled, took it, and signed his name. He put down the pen and grinned. He had just signed a piece of paper. A piece of paper that would change millions of people's lives. A camera flashed.

 DH_GER_Kuomintang.2.d:0 "Recent developments have left sour relations between the Germans and the Japanese. Tensions have been running high in the embassies of Berlin and Tokyo after the foreign minister of the German Reich, Joachim von Ribbentrop, declared on behalf of the entire German nation a condemnation of Japan's acts in China, which he labeled as “criminal” and “unprovoked”. Ministers in Japan have been left completely stunned and now face potential widespread backlash worldwide initiated by the Germans. \n\nRibbentrop added a lengthy statement pledging further German support for China, something not well received in Japan. This news came as a shock to the Japanese Emperor Hirohito himself. Though the emperor has been uninvolved in political affairs for many years now, Hirohito made a rare exception and compelled Japan's foreign minister, Yosuke Matsuoka, to demand an explanation from the German Reich. For days, no reply has been given from the German end, leaving an uncertain future between the two nations."

This morning, the headlines of the morning paper revealed: "Germany officially recognizes Manchukuo!". \n\nRecently, politics have revolved in a friendly matter between the Empire of Japan and the German Reich. It appears the Germans are seeking a potential partnership in the future. Of course, it is too early to determine for sure, but it seems this recognition of Manchukuo, Japan's puppet state in Manchuria, is a German attempt to show friendship. There is much to wonder about their relations, but it seems that many countries are pursuing possible alliances in this time of chaos. However, are Germany and Japan seeking a temporary nonaggression pact before they clash, or is legitimate co-operation they seek?"

 DH_GER_Naval_Agreement.1.d:0 "When the Great War came to a close, it was the will of the British people to punish Germany for her crimes against peace, so our diplomats shackled her with military restrictions and reparations to ensure the German eagle could never threaten us again. However, in recent years, public opinion has moved quite drastically in the other direction- due in no small part to the criticisms of economist John Maynard Keynes.\n\nWhen Germany's mass printing of currency to pay reparations caused the hyperinflation crisis in the '20s, the British people felt a sort of responsibility for the suffering of the Germans, and calls for leniency grew louder. \n\nAt the Foreign Office, an internal memo suggests that we begin to loosen military restrictions on Germany, and "Eliminate those parts of the Peace Settlement which, as practical people, we knew to be unstable and indefensible." Fortunately for us, we have an opportunity to do just that- the German Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler, has suggested in a recent speech that he would be willing to negotiate a naval rearmament treaty between our two countries. Shall we bring the Germans to the table?"
 DH_GER_Naval_Agreement.1.A:0 "Yes, invite the Germans to talks"

The British finally accepted Hitler's proposal of a 100:35 ratio, meaning the Kriegsmarine will be allowed to rearm and rebuild up to 35% of the Royal Navy's tonnage. Many in the foreign service believed the British would never agree to the ratio, and von Ribbentrop's unexpected success has won him great favor in Berlin's halls of power and with the Fuhrer himself.\n\nThe announcement of this treaty has enraged the French, who claim that Britain has no right to release Germany from the terms of the Versailles Treaty. Could the old allies be growing apart?"

Joachim von Ribbentrop and the head of the British delegation, Sir John Simon, signed a treaty that allows Germany to pursue limited naval rearmament while conceding naval dominance to the British.\n\nThe Fuhrer, recognizing the “necessity of naval dominance for the island nation” has agreed to limit the size of the Kriegsmarine to 35% of the Royal Navy's tonnage, allowing Germany to create a force equal to the French Marine Nationale.\n\nThe treaty's announcement met with outrage from the French, who claim that the United Kingdom has no legal right to release Germany from the treaty's restrictions.

A massive air and artillery barrage would then reduce the enemy strength to a point where an attack is feasible. Should we succeed and Switzerland be conquered, that "wayward branch" of the German people will finally rejoin their brothers in the Thousand Year Reich.

That is not to mention the limits provided by the federal system, with separate parliaments to control and democratic institutions to overcome - the obstacles to total power in Germany are uncountable.\nFor the strongmen eyeing the power of the Chancellor seat, these issues will be of immense concern.\n\n§RThe one thing holding Weimar democracy together is its own ineptitude.§!"

He has received the emergency powers he needed, allowing him to surpass Reichstag's permission to curb civil liberties in the name of restoring order to our fractured nation. However, this is not the end of the process of removing the ghosts of the Weimar bureaucracy. Hitler now has to contend with the limits of the Weimar constitution that even his emergency powers are restricted by. While his powers include the suspension of civil liberties ad hoc, the constitution still binds these powers.\n\nThe largest obstacle in the path of further expansion of these powers is the everpresent Reichstag, with separate parties still having the right to exist - many of which oppose the current Reichskanzler and the NSDAP-led coalition. A step too far and the coalition could fall apart and the emergency powers may be torn from the Reichskanzler. The bureaucracy remains, and laws must still be passed through the Reichstag - most of which continue to be opposed by the SPD and it's communist agitator allies.\n\n§RIf Germany is to be restored to its former glory, we must find a way to bring down our opposing parties once and for all.§!"

The Communist threat in Germany brought about its own downfall, and we have finally ended the bureaucracy of the Reichstag - with all other parties disbanding, either voluntarily or forcefully. Now, only one system stands in our way of total control of German politics - the Federal system.\n\nThe Federal System consists of seven state parliaments (Landtag(single); Landtagen(plural)), all of which are able to contest laws passed down from the Reichstag - and when they do, valuable time is wasted reconvening the Reichstag to get a two-thirds vote to pass laws through. Separate votes must take place to force the law through different local parliaments - and this won't do. Valuable time and effort are wasted, and to destroy the remnants of the old and weak systems, the final part of the Weimar bureaucracy must be removed.\nWhen action is taken and the federal system is replaced with something more malleable to the German people's wishes, we can be sure that the German state will run as smoothly as possible.\n\n§YWhat is Germany known for if not efficiency?§!"

Instead of building up their own fleet to maintain domination on the world stage, they have signed agreements with other nations to force limits on their navies. The London Naval Treaty is the first example of this, and now with the rearmament of the German nation scaling up to the British faster and faster, they are now attempting to put a limit on our inevitable rise.\n\nPerhaps, however - this agreement could lead to something more... pragmatic."
