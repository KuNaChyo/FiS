 DH_Ethiopia.1.t:0 "Wal Wal Incident"
 DH_Ethiopia.1.d:0 "The Italians have recently built a fort far within our borders in the Wal Wal Oasis, sparking tensions between our local forces and the garrison inside. A detachment of 1,000 Ethiopian militia has went to force out the garrison, but the Italians retaliated with a skirmish against our own troops. A rough estimate of 160 casualties has been sustained on both sides. Emperor Selassie has condemned the attack, and the Italians have demanded an apology for the incident."
 DH_Ethiopia.1.a:0 "To hell with the Italians!"

 DH_Ethiopia.2.t:0 "Abyssinia Crisis"
 DH_Ethiopia.2.d:0 "Merely two years after the first display of Italian aggression against our realm in Wal Wal, the Italians have already began showing aggression once more. Reports of build-up of Italian troops in Eritrea and Somali-land have sent panic to our border guards. In response to the crisis, Britain has imposed a arms embargo on both us and the Italians, but despite this, the clear aggressors show no signs of stopping. In response, Emperor Selassie has ordered the mobilization of the NDF."
 DH_Ethiopia.2.a:0 "It's time for the second round"

 DH_Ethiopia.3.t:0 "2nd Italo-Ethiopian War"
 DH_Ethiopia.3.d:0 "History repeats itself as Italian troops crossed our borders with no justification for war. Skirmishes were exchanged, as all negotiations with the League of Nations broke down despite the little efforts put up. Emperor Selassie has held a speed in Addis Adaba, calling for the Ethiopian people to mobilise against the aggressors who had returned to pillage once more."
 DH_Ethiopia.3.a:0 "Leniguše Negešitu!"

 ETH_Wal_Wal_Incident_desc:0 "Despite our best attempts to pressure the Italian-backed Somali garrison at Wal Wal to retreat from our sovereign territory, it seems that our efforts were to no avail. The Italians are on a warpath, after not only provoking our troops by engaging them, they have also brought about planes and armored cars to support their bids for the territory, the fragile treaty of non aggression set earlier this year seems to have been but hollow words…"

This great gift is but one testament of God’s good will towards the ever faithful people of Ethiopia. The other is splendent leadership of the great Emperor Haile Selassie, great saviour of the freedoms of Ethiopians, the magnificent reformer, the one that will lead us into a brave new era of prosperity!

It is now the duty of every Ethiopian to do their part and defend our lands from the powers that be and remind them of what happened to their previous expedition into Ethiopian territory."

 ETH_Consolidating_Royal_Titles:0 "Consolidating Royal Titles"
 ETH_Consolidating_Royal_Titles_desc:0 "The betrayal and attempted assassination in 1928 of the now Emperor Haile Selassie, then regent,, by the previous empress, followed by her untimely demise lead to a quick ascension to the throne for the young Emperor, valid to succession by his paternal grandmother’s lineage and after being nominated “negus”. While an impressive feat this speedy ascension and the turmoil caused by these palace infights have left the Monarch with little time to placate and to befriend the local nobility leading to instability, to fix this a demonstration of royal validity and a sequence of feasts and personal visits are scheduled to properly pacify the upper classes."

 ETH_Cult_of_Personality:0 "Cult of Personality"
 ETH_Cult_of_Personality_desc:0 "H.I.M Haile Selassie is a man whose presence is inspiring, his aquiline stare and proud stance give the impression of man with a cause, with a purpose and it shows. He is the very incarnation of all that is Ethiopia: a man of principles, honourable and the bearer of the most noble of causes, to defend his people, indeed a role model for all to follow. Being a collateral descendant of Queen of Sheba his reign has proof that it is sanctioned by the highest of powers, God; and he will use this holy sanction to protect the independence of and safety of all Ethiopians in face of the colonialist threat, his person is evidence that with faith, courage and a just cause even in the 20th century David can still beat Goliath."

 ETH_Greater_Privileges_for_the_Zebeyna:0 "Greater Privileges for the Zebeyna"
 ETH_Greater_Privileges_for_the_Zebeyna_desc:0 "The imperial guard has proved its loyalty to the emperor many times, formed in part by those whom had served as personal bodyguards for the Emperor during the tense political scheming under the Empress Zewditu, there’s also no lack of skill from their part either. It only makes sense that such men of valour be properly rewarded for their service, the members of the guard shall be henceforth be granted many benefits to show the Emperor’s good will towards them, among these benefits a quite major tax relief in comparison to the common ethiopian and even among the nobles, this petrifies their loyalty but what will the others think?"

 ETH_Reasserting_Noble_Perogatives:0 "Reasserting Noble Perogatives"
 ETH_Reasserting_Noble_Perogatives_desc:0 "Although it may seem calm right now, the atmosphere amidst the upper classes of Ethiopia is rather tense, The Emperor has been on the throne for a relatively short amount of years and his rise to power has been, to say the least, controversial. To make sure that the stability of the reign is cemented and that there’s no dissenting or militan thought through the noble ranks it is necessary to let them feel safe by confirming their birthright and to guarantee the continuation of these privileges for the time to come."

 ETH_Military_Loyalty_Oaths:0 "Military Loyalty Oaths"
 ETH_Military_Loyalty_Oaths_desc:0 "Every and any soldier who wishes to give his life for the sake of the country and Emperor, or has been drafted, needs to pronounce a series of binding oaths of direct servitude not only to the chain of command and country, but to the Emperor himself. Only then may a soldier be able to serve in the army and anything short of this can be considered as treason."

 ETH_Legacy_of_Solomon:0 "Legacy of Solomon"
 ETH_Legacy_of_Solomon_desc:0 "Our Emperor is the glory of our people, the light of our nation. His presence is awe inspiring, his merits are many, his faults are few and his fears are none because he knows as well as we do that it is the eternal glory of God that shelters us from all adversities so there is no need to fear when the loving hand of our Lord guides us. And so we ask: who better to lead our nation but the descendant of the most holy bloodline there is, who better to teach us how to love God but his most humble of servants, who is more loyal to the country than the man that was ready to give it all to keep it safe? There is but one answer: His imperial Majesty, Haile Selassie. Let us bask in his glory and wisdom as we move forward into these uncertain times and let us use him as our eternal guiding beacon until the day that God will lift him up from the earth and give him his rightful place in the great amalgamation of Saints.

 ETH_Finalise_The_Electric_Grid:0 "Finalize the Electric Grid"
 ETH_Finalise_The_Electric_Grid_desc:0 "Electricity has been a foreign concept to the ethiopian countryside for too long.

 ETH_Constructing_More_Schools:0 "Constructing More Schools"
 ETH_Constructing_More_Schools_desc:0 "Education is truly the foundation on which modern nations are built.

 ETH_Establishing_The_Ethiopia_Airways_desc:0 "To further connect our nation to the global community and economy, we are going to need make a country wide effort to establish our first proper international airport along with the first airborne routes to the major cities all over the world. Although it may not be used by most of our population, it is important to establish these ties for the sake of our economy and ability to conduct diplomacy on the world stage."

 ETH_Rural_Education_Scheme:0 "Rural Education Scheme"
 ETH_Rural_Education_Scheme_desc:0 "The future of tomorrow is built on the education of today! To upheave Ethiopia not only as a state but as a peoples, we must make a strenuous but necessary effort to not only increase the literacy of our nation which will put everyone on equal footing but also increase the standards of lower and higher education as to encourage a “homemade” intelligentsia so that we will no longer have to rely on foreign professors and skilled labour."

 ETH_State_Funded_Refineries:0 "State Funded Refineries"
 ETH_State_Funded_Refineries_desc:0 "Modern industry has one thing as its foundation: oil. Without oil, nothing moves forwards and nothing can be manufactured. God has given us this land and the fruits that it bears but amongst them oil is not one that is among the plentiful. Therefore, it is up to us to construct the proper machinery and infrastructure to make use of and refine this black gold into the fuel of our industry."

 ETH_Ammunition_Sector_of_Addis_Adaba:0 "Ammunition Sector of Addis"
 ETH_Ammunition_Sector_of_Addis_Adaba_desc:0 "Our army has relied for a long time on primitive weaponry and imported or “donated” weapons from the European powers at extortionate prices. This has lead to an incoherent army where some regiments are armed with spears and others with a mix-and-match of rifles and ammunition types. To be self sufficient in our defense, we must construct a local arms industry that can manufacture all the weapons that we need locally along with the required ammunition. This will not only make it easier to arm and maintain our soldier in a standardized manner, but it will be exponentially cheaper than having them imported from foreign countries."

 ETH_Enforce_Abolition_of_Slavery:0 "Enforce Abolition of Slavery"
 ETH_Enforce_Abolition_of_Slavery_desc:0 "In order to be seen as a properly civilized state, we must abolish slavery in our nation. While the capital might be a beacon of our progress, much of the country is stuck in the ways of old and continues to practice slavery despite the fact that it has been abolished since the Slavery Convention of 1926. We need to tackle this problem in a succinct and precise way in order finally eradicate this plague upon our people, even if it may displease the reactionaries and land owners, they’ll be dragged kicking and screaming into modernity if need be."

 ETH_Sidamo_Mining_Subsidies:0 "Sidamo Mining Subsidies"
 ETH_Sidamo_Mining_Subsidies_desc:0 "The south of Ethiopia is a region where agriculture is the prevalent form of sustenance and livelihood. However, prospectors have found proof of the existence of strategic resource deposits. Although hard to reach, investing into this area will no doubt bring many boons to us in form of precious ores."

 ETH_Connecting_The_Northern_Roads:0 "Connect the Northern Roads"
 ETH_Connecting_The_Northern_Roads_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, the state of our infrastructure remains poor. Only the cities are truly connected by well maintained roads! To allow more foreign trade and investment to reach us, a massive project to connect and modernize the roads that dot the northern portion of our country must be made."

 ETH_Subsiding_Coffee_Farms:0 "Subsiding Coffee Farms"
 ETH_Subsiding_Coffee_Farms_desc:0 "Ethiopia has a proud history of coffee production, with some even claiming that the drink originated from our lands. In any case, it could serve as an good form of income for us while we try to industrialize the nation. Subsidies would further help Ethiopian coffee compete on the international markets. "

 ETH_Imperial_Ethiopian_Air_Force:0 "Imperial Ethiopian Air Force"
 ETH_Imperial_Ethiopian_Air_Force_desc:0 "Modern warfare relies heavily on the presence of aircraft in the skies above the battlefield, a fight won in the sky may change the course of the battle on the ground. For this very reason Ethiopia should not falter in seeking to build a proper, competent airforce in order to bolster the offensive and defensive capabilities of its forces."

 ETH_Militarising_Lideta_Airport:0 "Militarising Lideta Airport"
 ETH_Militarising_Lideta_Airport_desc:0 "The REAF (Royal Ethiopian Air Force) will need a place to call home but due to the fact that most of our development is in the area of the capital, to build brand new military airports would be a great task indeed and would hinder our economic progress. However, as to not fall behind the rest of the world, we shall need to restrict part of the Lideta Airport in the capital for the sole use of our Air Force."

 ETH_Flight_Schools:0 "Flight Schools"
 ETH_Flight_Schools_desc:0 "What use is an air force that doesn’t know how to fly? In order to make proper use of our newly acquired aircraft a proper education centre for our pilots in all things that regard flight and airborne warfare is in order.

 ETH_Sticks_and_Stones_No_More_desc:0 "Even as late as 1896, in the war against Italy, around half of the Ethiopian foot soldiers used spears, bows and swords to fight on the battlefield. While this may have worked back then, military technology has advanced leaps and bounds since, killing in this day and age is more efficient than ever and any attempt to fight a modern army with our current weapons will lead to an unmitigated disaster. To combat this, a process of standardization of weaponry and equipment across all echelons of our ground forces is needed, the swords and spears of old will become family heirloom and the machine gun and grenade will become the new dealers of death."

 ETH_British_Military_Mission:0 "British Military Mission"
 ETH_British_Military_Mission_desc:0 "Despite the hawkish behaviour of the British towards us it would be foolish to deny the massive power they yield, their empire spans the entire globe, their navy rules all seas and their technology is at the avantgarde of all things that are war. We must swallow our pride and put aside our grievances with them for now and attempt to establish a formal relationship with them in order to acquire some of the vast knowledge they have accumulated. Only this way we can ensure a future for Ethiopia."

 ETH_Expanding_The_Holeta_Military_School_desc:0 "The rank and file soldiers have received their much deserved attention after an extended period of neglect. To lead this new army onto the battlefield the general staff will have to be reformed and educated in regards to everything that is modern warfare and the the officer corps will have to be expanded and given the same treatment. This has prompted the expansion and modernisation of the Holeta Military School facilities into a full blown Military Academy, this academy will serve as a central nerve in the reinvented organism that is our army."

 ETH_Importing_Western_Tanks:0 "Importing Western Tanks"
 ETH_Importing_Western_Tanks_desc:0 "Cavalry has become a thing of the past, new iron horses that can withstand innumerable bullets now roam the battlegrounds around the world, tanks. It would be a more than wise idea to start importing some of these machines for our army as to give it the necessary bite against any foe that dares to underestimate our forces."

 ETH_French_Artillery_Imports:0 "French Artillery Imports"
 ETH_French_Artillery_Imports_desc:0 "It is no secret that the French have been working on a major fortification project on the German border for years, this has geared their industry towards heavy emplacements to which artillery pieces are vital. This industrial gearing has also produced the benefit of surplus artillery pieces that can get sold off. The Ethiopian army is full of courageous men, but there’s nothing more devastating than a well placed howitzer shell within the files of an army, as such the foreign ministry has initiated the talks for the sale of surplus French artillery."

 ETH_African_Foreign_Legions:0 "African Foreign Legions"
 ETH_African_Foreign_Legions_desc:0 "The European colonizers have not been kind at all to the local tribes and ancestral peoples of Africa, enslaving them and treating like animals while exploiting and damaging the rich soil and the proud fauna of the continent. As of now Ethiopia stands as the only independent, native led nation in the whole of Africa. This has resulted in the proliferation of a revanchist and nationalist desire amid of the Africans that have escaped the chains and that live in Ethiopia thus leading to the creation of the African foreign troops within the borders of Ethiopia all of which are fueled by the desire of revenge against the Colonisers and hopefully one day the return to a liberated homeland."

 ETH_Submarine_Project:0 "Submarine Project"
 ETH_Submarine_Project_desc:0 "The advancements of technology in naval warfare have given rise to new ways to battle at sea, this is personified by the submarine. These submarines, being agile and cheap to produce, are a perfect choice for a developing navy such as ours as they are able to function as a deterrent against any harassing naval force intent on blockading or damaging our ports while not requiring extended training."

 ETH_Comission_New_Vessels:0 "Comission New Vessels"
 ETH_Comission_New_Vessels_desc:0 "Our newborn navy is full of capable men ready to serve but it is severely lacking in experience, and most importantly ships.

 ETH_Asmara_Naval_Academy:0 "Asmara Naval Academy"
 ETH_Asmara_Naval_Academy_desc:0 "To properly command our ships we are going to need a proper Naval High Command comprised of experienced and highly educated staff.

Here the best and brightest of Ethiopia will be congregated in order to fully apprehend the command at high sea."
 
 ETH_Coastal_Batteries:0 "Coastal Batteries"
 ETH_Coastal_Batteries_desc:0 "We can’t expect the navy to do all the work for the defense of our coasts. To ensure the safe sleep of the citizens of our nation we are going to need to establish a network of fortifications all along the coastline as to stop any planned foreign invasions via sea."

A country wide effort will be necessary to support this great task however once completed all Ethiopians will have reason to proud of their navy and will know to cherish it meanwhile our enemies and any ill intent force will have proof of the capabilities of a determined nation."

 ETH_Western_Dream_Achieved:0 "Western Dream Achieved"
 ETH_Western_Dream_Achieved_desc:0 "At long last, after having jumped over many hurdles, after having overcome many challenges and toiled to no end, the hard-working and dedicated Ethiopians, under the guidance of his imperial majesty, have made many strides towards the modernisation of their country. Even though not all of the country is homogeneously developed, the results of our progress is undeniable. Our society is no longer stuck 500 years in the past, our industry supplies us with what we need and the international community knows Ethiopia to be the beacon of civilization in Africa. Addis Ababa is now a bustling city, brimming with commercial and manufacturing activity. The population is now healthier and more civilized than it ever has been. Truly, our capital is the jewel in the Imperial Crown and the prototype of all future African cities."
