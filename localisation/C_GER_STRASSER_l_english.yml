DH_Germany_SA.1.t:0 "Hunt for Goring, Bormann, Hess, Himmler and Heydrich"
DH_Germany_SA.1.d:0 "The new Reich is as unstable as ever, and our new dream of true National Socialism cannot be achieved if traitors hinder our progress constantly. All enemies of the National Socialist revolution must be dealt with. Those who once patriotically yelled “Heil Hitler!” are already dead men. The SA was instructed to target three special rivals: Hermann Goring, Hitler's dear friend, a veteran of the Great War, and the head of the Luftwaffe. Martin Bormann, a leading Nazi Party official, and previously Adolf Hitler's private secretary. And Rudolf Hess, another veteran and the man appointed 'Deputy Fuhrer' to Hitler. \n\nIn a rapid strike by paramilitary SA forces, we managed to break into all their houses. Their resistance was dogged, but no much for the loyalty of our men. While attacking Goring, the old soldier refused to give in without a brawl. With a few handpicked bodyguards, he was able to hold off our efforts temporarily with machine-gun fire. Ammunition wouldn't allow him to keep it up. Meanwhile, Bormann was caught off guard busy in his bedroom and after a quick wrestle, the naked man was choked to death. Hess gave trouble too because a friend of his in the SA tipped him off. He attempted to enter a stolen fighter plane in his backyard, but Hess's pilot arrested him at gunpoint to save his own skin. \n\nThe threat of Goring and Hess, who were arrested alive but beaten, has been disposed of. Permanently. And all ten of Hess's associates in the SA have been executed to ensure nothing like this happens again. Though we may need to proceed with a few more attacks, the swift silencing of Goring, Borman, and Hess has shown the sheer power and will of the SA. There will be no mercy to traitors!"
DH_Germany_SA.1.A:0 "Five traitors dead, five steps closer to a pure Reich!"

DH_Germany_SA.2.t:0 "Death of Hjalmar Schacht"
DH_Germany_SA.2.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]He could barely register anything, as again the men hoisted him up the tree, the noose around his neck tightening with every pull until either his legs gave up under him or he slipped into consciousness, only to be woken up by either the kicks or the violent yanking of the SA-Men, who tried to get him to his feet so that they could read their mock sentence to him. Several times they tried to have him stand with his own power, but soon it became apparent that the first beating had been already enough to scar the former minister for the rather short rest of his life. In the end, they had to be content with pushing him down onto his knees and vaguely pulling his head towards the man standing in front of him.\n\n“By order of the Stabschef of the SA, Ernst Röhm, I Lennart Lummer Rottenführer of the SA, sentence you to death for your crimes against the German people, the SA and the nation of Germany as a whole. The sentence will be fulfilled by hanging. Or torture.”\n\nDesperately he hoped that they would choose the first option and finally be done with him, but alas the hard punch in his liver showed that they choose the way of the SA. Still reeling on the floor, gasping for air, they offered no time to recover and further subjected him to kicks, punches, and cuts, until he was no longer able to feel the individual wounds only a wave of pain engulfing his entire body. He tried to fight back, but nothing he could do now would save his life, only the slim chance that the pain would stop soon was worth fighting for.\n\nAnd so in the last calculated move of his life, Hjalmar Schacht, the former economic minister of Germany, a civilized man, by all means, bit down hard on the hand, that was close to his face.„Ahh, the cunt bit me! “Are you okay, Johann?” “No, I´m not! Damn, I think I need stitches. Goddammit, it fucking hurts.” “Calm down, we will go to the hospital soon enough, we need to take care of this traitor, here first. Okay Gerd, get him on his knees. We do it my way.”"

DH_Germany_SA.4.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Chaos continues to descend upon the fragmented German Reich.\nThe SA, once an ally of Adolf Hitler and his associates, has turned on their former Führer.\nEvery morning, the sun reveals pale corpses hung up next to a lamp post. On their necks is a sign, painted with the words \"Schmutz\". Filth.\n\nLast night, the Night of the Rope, frenzied SA paramilitary soldiers started breaking into mansions.\nThe fervour grew until the groups began dragging rich people, "reactionaries", and other such "scum" into the streets, beating them to death.\nThe SA were sure to target and hunt down SS members brutally, slaughtering even their families in the process.\nIt was a disgusting sight for morning workers, frozen bodies rotting in the open. The streets were not cleared until late afternoon. \n\nHeinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich, once prominent members of the Nazi Party, were also eliminated.\nA few witnesses claimed they saw processions of SA radicalists marching out of Himmler's and Heydrich's houses, carrying bright torches in the dark night.\nNeedless to say, they will probably never be heard of again.\n\nLet us just hope that they were shot and didn't suffer a gruesome fate at the hands of those torches..."
DH_Germany_SA.4.A:0 "This blood is a stain on German pride, and one that will be difficult to cleanse."

DH_Germany_SA.5.t:0 "The Diarchy"
DH_Germany_SA.5.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Slowly, like dust after a great sandstorm, the great turmoil brought on by the SA Revolution is calming down. But in its place is something much more frightening.\nAn undeclared rivalry has erupted between the two most prominent remaining politicians.\nRohm and Strasser emerged with newfound power after the revolution, snatching the influence of the old Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler.\nIn the flash of an instant, one of their actions could spark devastating civil war that would plunge Germany into chaos once more.\n\nAs the stability of Germany teeters on a knife edge, Rohm and Strasser secretly examine eachother for weaknesses. Rohm is a violent and disorganized man, known more for his drunken rage than his sly tactics. In fact, Rohm himself had invited his new enemy into the government.\nHe has a loyal following from the lower classes, who, despite being uneducated, are better warriors.\nStrasser is more known for his politics. Currently, Strasser is indeed of less power, but his men are far more organized, some them being in the party itself.\nBut in these dangerous times, loyalty is an unpredictable thing.\nRohm and Strasser must be cautious not to repeat Hitler's mistake..."
DH_Germany_SA.5.A:0 "How many Germans will be left if this civil war leads to another purge?"


DH_Germany_SA.6.t:0 "Reichstag? More like Ghost-tag"
DH_Germany_SA.6.d:0 "Instability was a mere euphemism to the anarchy of the Weimar Republic. Peace and order were luxuries that even the Almighty Dollar cannot pay, much less the measly Reichsmark. No more than in the Reichstag does this fact hold merit, for no longer was it a sanctuary of debate and parliamentary procedure, but just a brawling arena for the many paramilitaries and thugs who were willing to throw a punch or two, maybe even pump an unlucky legislator full of lead. Healthy Debate as usual in the Republic.\n\nThat is until Rohm's thugs started painting the walls red.\n\nWhat was once the symbol of chaos became the haven of tranquillity. Silence finally prevailed in the Reichstag, yet the stains remain. The walls, the doors, the chairs, the podiums - all soaked with the blood of legislators and others not towing the party line. Some incinerated, others dumped into the Spree River, while the more notable ones received a "burial" in Republic Square.\n\nAs the old guard fell to their demise, new faces quickly took their positions. From veteran party officials to Rohm's representatives, they only have one duty - to swing their rubber stamp. No need to voice an objection or question party policy, just approve and payment received. The Reichstag is just a loudspeaker now, filled with shells who sold their soul to the party. The Reaper need not wait for their souls, for it has already arrived at his domain."

DH_Germany_SA.9.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]“I will not accept this attack against my authority!” The soldier shouted, crashing his fist onto the table. “Herr Röhm, please calm down. I want to discuss our policy with you and I see no sense in it when you are unreceptive to my ideas.” The secretary countered, trying to keep his own calm and not be affected by the gorilla beating his chest in front of him. “Now if you would excuse me, I wanted to explain how restoring the party's oversight over your men would-” “Its Stabschef Röhm, you insolent paper pusher! I will not accept this pathetic try of a power grab! You are even worse than Hitler, you goddamn scumbag! I should have shot with the others!” “And yet I am here because you know that you are just incompetent to organize anything other than this pathetic horde, that you call an army!” The secretary had risen from his seat and now was ready to fire back. “You know damn well that you need me and I will be happy to assist you, but what I am not ready to do is enable you while you lead this country into Anarchy!”\n\n“Oh, you really think that I need your help? You are wrong, you prick! Get out, go to hell, or whatever! OUT!”\n\n“Herr Stabschef, I am afraid that is not possible.” The Propagandist had so far, being quiet and now moved himself to the Secretary's end of the table. “You see Herr Strasser is a highly competent administrator as well as a dear friend of mine. Seeing him go would greatly jeopardize Germany's future, while also putting a loyal german on the chopping block. I assure you that if you fire Herr Strasser, that I will inform other Germans of your various failures.”\n\nThe content of these words struck the soldier like a sledgehammer. Where mere seconds ago was a livid and self-confident man, now was a scarred wreck of a man, stammering to find an answer. Alas, he would never find it, instead choosing to storm out of the room, but not before smashing a glass on the floor, hoping to at least save a bit of his reputation."
DH_Germany_SA.9.A:0 "This moment of weakness has been observed and noted."

DH_Germany_SA.10.t:0 "Return of Otto Strasser"
DH_Germany_SA.10.d:0 "After being expelled from the NSDAP by the traitorous Hitlerite faction, Otto Strasser formed the Combat League of Revolutionary National Socialists (better known as the Black Front), out of fellow left-wing Nazis who believed that the party leadership at the time had strayed from the original anti-capitalist ideals of the national socialist vision.\n\nNow that the traitorous Hitler has been removed, Otto has made a triumphant return, and in doing so, has merged his band of radical national socialists with the rest of the NSDAP. \n\nNaturally, Party Secretary Gregor Strasser intends to give his brother an important position and has come across two that would suit Otto perfectly. The first choice is Gauleiter of the NSDAP/AO, the foreign organization of the party, and the second is the position of Economics Minister. These are both important positions that will satisfy Otto’s ambitions, and play a part in acquiring a prosperous future for the fatherland."
DH_Germany_SA.10.A:0 "The position of Gauleiter will make the best use of Otto’s talents."
DH_Germany_SA.10.B:0 "As the minister of economics, Otto Strasser will bring great prosperity to Germany!"

DH_Germany_SA.11.t:0 "Storm in the Rhine"
DH_Germany_SA.11.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Yesterday, SA paramilitary forces entered the Rhineland en masse, an insulting violation of the Treaty of Versailles. The Rhineland was set a demilitarized zone to ensure Germany will never line their men on the French border again. The SA soldiers, dressed proudly in their sharp grey uniforms, stormed into the Rhineland in columns, singing the German national anthem. French and British diplomats protested loudly about this overt breach of the Versaille treaty. However, their furious cries eventually wound down into weak complaints as the fact remained/:/ The SA is not affiliated with the German military ... yet. This shows German intentions of re-armament, the very thing Versaille sought to prevent. Not only that, but it has revealed the soft backbone of the French and British politicians. While France at least moved some divisions to the border, Britain avoided any military actions. It seems the two countries are willing to go to great lengths to prevent another world war. These developments all go in the favour of the Germans, as they gain confidence from the indecisiveness of the two allies. It is unclear what German intentions are, but it is expected that Rohm will attempt to restore Germany's former borders."

DH_Germany_SA.13.t:0 "The Second Wave"
DH_Germany_SA.13.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The Night of the Rope. A night that all people across the German Reich remember with stone-cold fear. That night, the SA thugs were focused on eliminating politial rivals like Heinrich Himmler. In their beds, children could hear the countless screams, the crack of bullets, and then a gut-wrenching silence as everyone prayed to hear the SA marching in the distance, not the dreadful crescendo of boots outside their doors. But gradually, the blood that was shed was allowed to dry.\n\nUntil the streets were coated in red by Death once more.\n\nThe SA was restless due to the recent lack of activity, and at midnight, drunken henchmen prowled the empty streets looking for suspicious civilians to attack. Nobody was outside due to the recent hangings. Robbed of a brawl, the bloodthirsty SA brutes busted into the mansions of industrialists and bankers. Many prominent businessmen were dragged out of their homes and herded into the freezing streets. Stragglers or those who resisted were beaten or shot. Others simply froze of hypothermia.\n\nBy dawn, the chaos had subsided. Victims included Fritz Thyssen, Alfried Krupp, Max Warburg, and Kurt Baron von Schröder. The event was covered up by Rohm, but rumours of a Second Wave of hangings inspired fear in all."
DH_Germany_SA.13.A:0 "How long will the brutes go unpunished?"

DH_Germany_SA.14.t:0 "Rohm's Title"
DH_Germany_SA.14.d:0 "Ernst Rohm currently holds the title of Chief of the Sturmabteilung, and through the organisation’s grip on the nation, is also the leader of Germany. However, these titles are not particularly formal and don’t lend themselves very well to the power and authority that The Brute wields. To rectify this, he will have to make a choice between two different titles, Reichskanzler, or Führer.\n\nThe title of Reichskanzler, or Chancellor, possesses a sense of gravitas and could convey Rohm’s authority effectively. It would be a good choice if it weren’t tainted by the fact that Adolf Hitler, a traitor to Germany and the national socialist vision, once held this position. This could be overlooked, but any association with the traitor, in any manner could spell trouble for the SA Chief’s rule.\n\nThe same is true for the title of Führer, or Leader, which is a shame, since it is such a powerful title, and is absolutely worthy of a man with the power that Rohm holds.\n\nThere is a third choice, however, and that is for Rohm’s title to remain as Chief of the Sturmabteilung. This is certainly the least prestigious of all the choices, but it is the safe choice, as it removes the possibility of any parallels drawn between Rohm and Hitler.\n\nSo, what shall The Brute’s title be?"
DH_Germany_SA.14.A:0 "Gravitas, authority, power, the position of Reichskanzler has it all."
DH_Germany_SA.14.B:0 "Rohm will lead Germany into a prosperous future, it is only fitting that he should be called the Führer."
DH_Germany_SA.14.c:0 "Any association with Hitler could be detrimental to Germany’s future, Rohm shall remain the Chief of the SA."

In the midst of his arrest of our leader, a brave SA patrol managed to stop him before he could take him away, beating the traitor to a bloody pulp before fully apprehending him. All across the country, chaos has ensued as our men have been called to arms, dealing with the small Reichswehr detatchments that would seek to destroy the Second Revolution and Germany along with it. \n The working class have been betrayed too long with the glorified corporal Hitler on top, and his betrayal of our great leader Herr Rohm is the final straw! His corrupt strongman cabinet has been replaced by a hastly assembled cabinet under Rohm consisting entirely of SA members loyal to the Revolution above all else.

We shall send our best men on a manhunt for his inner clique - namely Minister of Prussia, Herman Goering, who spends more money on luxuries for himself than food for the people, Former Deputy of the Nazi Party and Reichsleiter, Martin Bormann - who spends more time sucking up to the traitor Herr Hitler than anything else, and Deputy Fuhrer Rudolf Hess. With these elements of Hitler's inner clique captured, his faction of the National Socialist party should fall apart like a house of cards, giving the SA complete domination over party and country politics - as it should.

As the face of the Sturmabteilung, the sheer amount of blood that was spilled and the brutality caused by the revolution has not reflected too kindly on the now de-facto leader of the country, and he has now been aptly nicknamed “The Brute”.

While this currently works fine, it is a possibility that these nations will stop their exports to Germany for unspecified reasons.\nIn order to secure our economic independence, we will find the „Reichswerke Otto Strasser“ a huge conglomerate of state-owned companies that will help us access Germanys resources which so far have been untapped, due to their general inaccessibility and the unwillingness of the capitalist to utilize these „unprofitable“ resources, while also creating a huge number of stable jobs for the German populace."

 GER_Stadt_des_KdfWagens_desc:0 "While the SA was the main force behind the second revolution, we should not forget the workers who are the lifeblood of both Germany and the SA. To give something back to the workers, Ernst Rohm has devised a program that would make a personal car access to the bulk of the German populace.\nDubbed the „KdF-Wagen“, after the suborganization of the DAF, Rohms plan calls for the establishment of a truly gigantic car factory in the quaint city of Fallersleben, which will produce greater numbers of cars for the general populace, while also reducing unemployment in the area to near zero, with the Fallersleben becoming the official city of the Kdf-Wagen."

 GER_Turn_the_SA_into_the_Police_desc:0 "The Hilfspolizei was an auxiliary police force containing branches of the Sturmabteilung and Schutzstaffel formed by Hermann Goring in 1933 to assist the regular police force in destroying communist sympathisers and other enemies in the aftermath of the Reichstag fire. However, it was only active for a month, since Hitler lost faith in the SA, and felt that there was no longer a threat to his regime. But he is no longer in power, we are.\n\nDue to the nature in which we gained power, there are certainly some dissenting influences similar to the ones that Hitler faced, and they pose a threat to our agenda and our plans. To fix these problems, we must follow the approach that brought Hitler success, and revive the Hilfspolizei. This time, it will remain a permanent part of our law enforcement branch, and will continue to protect Herr Rohm’s administration after our initial enemies are defeated."

All throughout the country we will give our men a free ticket to “confiscate“ all the property they desire while anyone that doesn´t fit into our new Germany will be roughed up and arrested.\nBones will be broken, windows will be smashed, synagouges will be raided and set alight while we,the brave men of Germany, will breath in the ashes and pour a drink for our fallen comrades and on Germanys awaking! And should anyone be stupid enought to stand in our way, we will be sure to give them a good strong noose, made by the brave lads of the SA!"

However, the Treaty of Versailles is clear, and we can’t afford to challenge the Western democracies directly right now. There is a loophole though, the Sturmabteilung is not considered to be an official army, so we can technically send the SA into the Rhineland to “restore order”, despite the fact that there are already a few Sturmabteilung units stationed there. This will effectively remilitarise the Rhineland, and the Western democracies won’t be able to do a single thing about it."

Conspiring together with Jews and foreign powers, they seek to end the revolution and destroy everything we have achieved so far. As proud sons of Germany, we will not let them succeed! Preemptive measures must be taken against these class enemies and it will not be pretty. We will drag them out of their fancy homes, rob them blind of all their possessions and if they are lucky they will end quickly when put a bullet in their face, hang them or stomp them into the curb. The unlucky ones will be left to die on the streets, starved and broken, so that they can understand the plight of the Germans, who they robbed and on whose hard-work they grew rich on. No exceptions will be made, no inch will be given and when we are done Germany will be one step closer towards a better society."

 GER_Reorganize_the_Camps:0 "Reorganize the Camps"
 GER_Reorganize_the_Camps_desc:0 "When we were under Hitler’s regime we assisted in the construction of dozens of labor camps for political enemies. These camps must now be reorganized against the political enemies of the revolution, not the political enemies of Hitler. Forced labor is productive, and can even benefit us by producing materials needed for the revolution, but as a system of punishment for subversives, it is flawed. The enemies of the revolution are still able to escape, they are still able to plot the demise of the revolution and the proletariat. This can not be allowed, we must consolidate the camps under new organization. These camps must be made to kill the enemies of the people and the revolution. Holding them in forced labor and bondage costs us and might be the end of the revolution if the inmates get out of hand. A dead inmate can’t start a revolution, so why keep them alive?"

 GER_Rohms_title:0 "Rohm's Title?"
 GER_Rohms_title_desc:0 "The revolution has progressed sufficiently, we have dealt with many class enemies and problems along the way. However, we now have a serious question on the minds of many politicians. What is Herr Rohm’s official title? He is the leader of the SA, but is that all? Surely he would want to be something important, like the leader of the party... perhaps even the Fuhrer?\n\nThe Fuhrer title perfectly sums up Rohm’s role in Germany - he is indeed the leader of the revolution and bringer of the future of Germany. All of the oppressed workers and the proletariat look up to him. However, Hitler took the title Fuhrer and the title is now stained with his mere presence. No German citizen can look at the title of Fuhrer and not think of him.\n\nThere is another title Rohm could take: Reichskanzler. The title dates as far back as the Holy Roman Empire, used by German heroes like Otto Von Bismarck. Unfortunately, Hitler was also the Reichskanzler once before he took power as Fuhrer. Thus, that title is also stained with his presence. Rohm could take no title, and continue with the current status quo. This ensures that the stain that Hitler's name has left on the revolution no longer remains.\n\nIt is all up to the torchbearer... what shall he be known as?"

 GER_Undermine_the_legal_institutions:0 "Undermine the "Legel" Institutions"
 GER_Undermine_the_legal_institutions_desc:0 "We must change Germany for the better, and since the revolution has been a massive success on the military front, we can now focus on more problems at home. The banks, schools, and the markets are not currently in the way Rohm would like them. The schools are not yet teaching the youth, which are the future of Germany about Rohm and National Socialist ideals. The banks are still supporting the regular practices, and the markets are not following the centralized economy that Rohm wants.\n\nTo fix this, we are going to undermine these institutions. The schools will now have children pledge allegiance to Rohm and Germany, and teach our children about the horrors the Class enemies have shoved upon the proletariat. The banks will be closed, and their wealth distributed among the people. The markets will be nationalized and changed to follow Rohm’s plans. Germany will be reformed into Rohm’s Germany, a national socialist country that will last hundreds of years, and it starts with undermining the “legal” institutions."

Corporate cartels abuse our workers, both foreign and local. They disregard human lives and let them work the harshest conditions, all the while profiting from their labor.
