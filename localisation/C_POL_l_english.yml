 DH_POL_Death_of_Pilsudski.1.t:0 "Pilsudski, The Polish “Iron Man”, Dead"
 DH_POL_Death_of_Pilsudski.1.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Amidst the political tension in Europe, Marshal Józef Piłsudski has suddenly passed away today in Warsaw's Belweder Palace from previously unbeknown health issues. The entire nation of Poland has entered an immediate period of mourning as the nation recounts him as a world-renowned general and a powerful statesman, with the past as the liberator of Poland, victor of the Polish-Soviet War and a visionary amidst an unstable period in the nation's history. His death may leave a lasting effect on Polish society, as his cult-like status may ascend him as a national hero amongst Poland's many people, with even pope Pius XI calling himself "a friend of Piłsudski" and shortly holding a ceremony in his honor a few days later at the League of Nations headquarters in Geneva. What followed suit were numerous condolences and services by world leaders, including the likes of [leader of the soviet union] and [leader of germany] paying their respects outside of political differences.\n\nHowever, some who opposed him were less than sympathetic, such as the Polish Communist Party and some of the democratic opposition, who have come to go on a full campaign of denouncement, calling him vehemently a fascist dictator with no regards for liberty. The rest of the opposition, while directly seeing Piłsudski as a rival, have shown their condolences in spite of conflict.\n\nAlas, the future of the nation's political scene and it's ruling Sanation party lays unknown as the power vacuum of Piłsudski's reign calls for a successor amongst his many past political allies."

 DH_POL_Front_Morges.1.t:0 "The Foundation of Front Morges"
 DH_POL_Front_Morges.1.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]While there has been little thought given to the democratic opposition since the full domination of the Sanation party even after it's fracturing, the centrist parties of the '20s are still active, albeit smaller today. In Switzerland in the village of Morges, a political alliance dubbed the "Front Morges" was signed by the leaders of the Christian Democrat and National Workers parties, the veteran organization called the Union of Hallerians, former prime minister Ignacy Paderewski and general Władysław Sikorski. \n\nThe main idea behind this rather uncharacteristic alliance was to form a united front against the Sanation party by means of forming a new democratic government with Paderewski as president and Wincenty Witos as a prime minister. Yet in spite of the major figures involved in such an alliance, the party has gained little publicity and even less support amongst the people back in Poland, further pushing it to the edges of obscurity, even with the confidence of some of its more prominent members."
 DH_POL_Front_Morges.1.A:0 "They can only do little by this point" 

 DH_POL_Sanation.1.t:0 "The Sanation Party Fractures"
 DH_POL_Sanation.1.d:0 "After several weeks of meetings, talks inside the Bezpartyjny Blok Współpracy z Rządem have devolved into walk outs and shouting matches. The collapse of the party has sent ripples across Polish society, with many losing all confidence in the government after the death of our charismatic leader. While the opposition outside of the Sanation Movement has continued to show low approval in public and in the Sejm, the situation in Europe demands a stable government.Inside the party, Walery Sławek, the former prime minister from 1930 and a good friend of the Marshal, has renounced his loyalty for the rest of Sanation and announced his intention to become president of the republic under a left wing reformist faction known as ‘The Colonels,’ most of their leaders being Pilsudski’s closest army officers. Our current president, assigned by Piłsudski himself, Ignacy Mościcki, has reaffirmed the public that he will stay in power as wished by ‘his dear friend himself’, with political observers labeling his side as a status-quo Sanation Center, or ‘Castle’ faction, after the fact that the man resides in Warsaw's foreboding castle. Finally, Commander-in-chief Edward Rydż-Smigły has also thrown his hat into the ring and announced his bid for leadership under his own right wing political thought, known as ‘OZON’, despite his low domestic support but high army popularity.In the public realm, the conflict between the three giants is seemingly down to only two men - Sławek and Mościcki. However, Rydz-Śmigły’s control of the armed forces cannot be ignored, as many in Europe have found out. Until one man can claim victory, the battle lines threaten to pull Poland apart."
 DH_POL_Sanation.1.A:0 "This is like 1927 all over again!" 

 DH_POL_Sanation.2.t:0 "The Foundation of Front Morges"
 DH_POL_Sanation.2.d:0 "Since the total domination of the Sanation Movement, there has been little thought given to the democratic opposition in the Sejm but the centrist parties of the 20's are still very much active. While they are much smaller in size and not well known, the fracturing of the former BBWR party has provided a narrow window of opportunity for a return to domestic politics.\nIn the village of Morges along the banks of Lake Geneva in Switzerland, a political alliance dubbed the "Front Morges" was signed by the several leaders of fringe democratic parties and movements. The Christian Democrats and National Workers parties, along with the veteran based ‘Union of Hallerians’ association, united behind former Prime Minister Ignacy Paderewski and General Władysław Sikorski. The main idea behind this rather uncharacteristic alliance was to form a united coalition front against the authoritarian Sanation by means of a new democratic government with Paderewski as president and ‘Polish People’s Party’ leader, Wincenty Witos, as a prime minister, with Sikorski taking command of the armed forces.\nDespite the impressive lineup of the major political figures involved in such an alliance, Polish trust in true democracy is the lowest in the history of the ‘Republic.’ The party has gained little publicity in Europe abroad and even less support amongst the citizens back in Poland. They would have a long difficult road ahead, but perhaps under certain circumstances, could find themselves at the helm of a true polish democracy."
 DH_POL_Sanation.2.A:0 "Less like a coalition, more like a cluster" 

 DH_POL_Sanation.3.t:0 "The Path of the Second Republic"
 DH_POL_Sanation.3.d:0 "Ever since the Death of Marshal Pilsudski, Poland has teetered on the brink of political chaos. The Sanation movement fractured almost immediately upon his death, divided into three groups.A definitive mid-runner, the Sanation left under PM Walery Slawek seeks to reform the governmental system into a ‘live and let live’ format with the parties that have been mostly excluded from executive politics since the May Coup - planning on repealing the mosauthoritarian factors of the government. A good option for sure, albeit a semi-unlikely one - Slawek has proven himself to be capable in a crisis before, and he could do it again.The collective centre of the Sanation movement holds their loyalty with President Ignacy Moscicki. Supporters of the previously held status quo established by the April Constitution ratified by the Sejm, they back a man who never deviated from the Marshal’s will - with everyone knowing of his loyalty, he is the frontrunner in the race for power.Generał Rydz-Śmigły. The black sheep of the three candidates, not too well known in the political sphere. A lynchpin in the 1926 Coup, Rydz was rewarded by being appointed Marshal Pilsudski’s deputy. His military background and preference by the Marshal have given Rydz the potential to stake his claim for Poland’s leadership.One last option remains. Rallying around Wladyslaw Sikorski, a large group of centrist parties have formed a democratic united front, the Front Morges - dedicated to restoring Polish democracy. These are unstable times - if the Sanation movement does not find a solution to its power struggle, then perhaps this alternative is the only way for Poland to persist.Four Kings make their move and Poland hangs in the balance. When Pilsudski's funeral toll silences, what will the nation awake to"
 DH_POL_Sanation.3.A:0 "Change is the law of life. All for Slawek!"
 DH_POL_Sanation.3.B:0 "The Castle’s walls hold - Moscicki holds firm!"
 DH_POL_Sanation.3.C:0 "Pen and Sword in alliance - Rydz victorious!"
 DH_POL_Sanation.3.D:0 "The Sanation is in pieces - no more tyrants!"

 DH_POL_Sanation.4.t:0 "Poland's Second Great Leader"
 DH_POL_Sanation.4.d:0 "They say that great men lead to good times - and weak men follow soon after. Yet, behold! For Poland is not privy to such a weakness. The Second Man in the State, Rydz-Śmigły, has spent the time since Marshal Pilsudski’s death as what was once considered an underdog. Now, however, he is what Pilsudski once was - the lynchpin that holds Poland together.\nThe new Marshal has walked through the streets of Lwow, Bialystok, Gdansk and Warsaw and seen how his work has been accomplished. No longer do the ethnicities clash in the streets as they once did - the Ukrainian, Jew, Pole, Lithuanian - they all coexist under the Polish banner. Perhaps not as utopian hand-holding friends, but they all coexist out of loyalty to Pilsudski, Pilsudski’s ideals and Pilsudski’s one true successor.\nThe streets are no longer destitute, filled with the hungry and the homeless, those put out of work thanks to economic instability maintained by an inept government too stuck up with their own pride to be pragmatic. Now they are filled with workers going on with their lives, average citizens that can afford to live and be proud of what they have. Poland’s streets are clean, its social policies beneficial for all - all thanks to the new Marshal’s state reforms, changing what once was a bureaucratic nightmare into an efficient machine, making changes when it suits the material conditions of the Polish people.\nOur new Marshal - the hero who held the line at Warsaw threw back the Russians in 1920, a hero who helped make Poland the nation what it is today alongside the former Marshal Pilsudski - one who does, and god willing, will continue to make Poland proud under his leadership. All for Marshal Rydz-Śmigły, all for Poland!"

 DH_POL_1933_Election.1.t:0 "The Sejm Reelects Moscicki to the Presidency"
 DH_POL_1933_Election.1.d:0 "Ratified with thunderous applause, Ignacy Mościcki was re-elected as President of Poland by the state Sejm earlier this morning. Moscicki's first term lasted seven years, and his election in 1926 came at a turbulent time in the Republic. The May Coup earlier that year, had removed both the President and Prime Minister from office. Marshall Pilsudski had won the presidency in an immediate election after the coup but upon realizing that the office had little executive power, he declined to take the role. Instead, he called for a new election and pushed a politically unknown Moscicki, a chemist at Warsaw Polytechnical, to run for the position. While he was a member of Pilsudski's Polish Socialist Party, he had no prior experience in government or politics, meaning that most of the real power would remain with Pilsudski, while Ignacy built repertoire and maintained his loyalty to the Marshall.\nBut that was then, and this is now. With their joint BBWR party now solidly in power, commanding most of the votes in the Sejm, Ignacy Moscicki was elected to his position with 332 votes out of the 343 members present, the only candidate with enough support to be nominated. With a previous seven years of knowledge under his belt, he shall continue to guide the Republic with prowess, dignity, and most of all, the Marshall's guidance."

 DH_POL_1933_Election.2.t:0 "New Prison Camp in Bereza Kartuska"
 DH_POL_1933_Election.2.d:0 "Communists, terrorists, Ukrainian and Belarusian separatists, and other political subversives remain a constant threat to security, peace, and social order. The assassination of Minister of Internal Affairs Bronisław Pieracki by a Ukrainian Nationalist is proof enough that we need to contain these dangerous individuals. The government has decided to establish an institution where these criminals will remain as far away from society as possible. The main objective of the Bereza Kartuska prison is to isolate people whose activities could threaten public security. In this regard, we will focus on those troublemakers that could be potential dangers to our authority, specially sympathizers for Germany or National Socialism. The management of the institution based around an old Tsarist prison will fall under the authority of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Department's Nationalities Section. Exceptional circumstances require radical solutions to protect the country from potential internal enemies."

 DH_POL_1933_Election.3.t:0 "The Westerplatte Incident"
 DH_POL_1933_Election.3.d:0 "Earlier this morning, an entire marine battalion was landed along the docks of the Westerplatte Peninsula, while crowds of civilians looked on with curiosity. The harbor was in an area of tension between us, the Germans, and the Danziger's. With the Danzig government trying to subsidize control over our dually led harbor police force, and the German politicians calling for border adjustments in the region, we had little choice but to deploy more men to the outpost as a show of force.\nThe German and Danzig governments had much to say about our move, seeing it as an act of aggression, and for the Danziger's, a nail in the coffin for their plan to seize control over the harbor police force. With rising pressures from Germany, the Free City, and the League of Nations, we managed to broker a deal. In exchange for the Free Cities' withdrawal of their objections to our prior dual control agreement of the harbors police force, our troops would withdraw from the outpost to ease tensions."
 DH_POL_1933_Election.3.A:0 "Yet another thing the Germans can hate us for."

 DH_POL_1933_Election.4.t:0 "Loyality to Poland, Loyality to the Marshall"
 DH_POL_1933_Election.4.d:0 "Byelorussians, Ukrainians, Germans, Lithuanians, Slovaks and Jews; Poland has always been a land of many ethnicities and now is no different. Poland and its’ Lithuanian brethren occupied vast swathes of land in the power vacuum that followed the collapse of the Mongols in the 13th Century. Poland has experience with dealing with runaway ethnicities - however, for the past century the Polish have become the runaway ethnicity - a thorn in the sides of multiple empires, the brave warriors fighting for independence. However, the nationalism that got Poland to where it is today serves as the bane of its own stability, as continuously imposed ethnic assimilation policies on hostile ethnicities has only served to make the life of the fledgling nation even more difficult than it has to be. Thus; the ethnicities must be unified under a nation instead of being assimilated - and what better to unify people of all colours and creeds than a hero?\nJosef Pilsudski - the breaker of the Bolsheviks, bringer of Polish independence - he, to all Poles, represents what keeps the nation together; The Polish nation irrelevant of race under Marshall Pilsudski, defender of all peoples. Under his eye, all people in the nation’s borders will remove their heels from the ground and come to respect its authority, if only because the Nation is an extension of his."

 DH_POL_1933_Election.5.t:0 "Safeguarding the Rzeczpospolita"
 DH_POL_1933_Election.5.d:0 "Pilsudski exited his automobile once again outside the Sejm, his ears filling with the usual chorus of cheers from the people who come to see him go about his business everyday. He can’t help but smile; he knows that he is the lynchpin of politics and stability in this nation and as he walks into the Sejm and sees the eyes of its members look at him with a mix of awe and fear he knows they understand it too.\nHe takes his seat, brushing a hand back through his hair. One year ago, these glorified bureaucrats dragged their heels in over small decisions that shouldn’t have taken more than a few minutes to read over and sign - instead taking hours. Such was democracy, Pilsudski thought - but no longer. A bit of force and a new constitution, and now Poland is no longer held back by the weakness of the democratic process.\nHe hears the cheers outside and the members of the Sejm look at him like lost puppies seeking guidance. Poland truly was a fledgling nation, its government members childlike in experience; if it was up to him to guide them then so be it. He got to his feet with an internal chuckle, walked up to the presidential podium and began his address with his usual gruff demeanor."

 DH_POL_Colonel_Government.1.d:0 "Prior to the death of Marshal Pilsudski, Edward Rydz-Smigly, the General Inspector of the Armed Forces, was slowly growing in power, but now, in an effort to fill the vacuum that Pilsudski left behind, his reach and influence have grown rapidly, much to the disgruntlement of some men. This ascent has culminated in his promotion to Marshal of Poland, formally succeeding Jozef Pilsudski.\nThe road to becoming the “Second Man in the State after the President”, however, wasn’t easy, as the infighting between himself, President Ignacy Moscicki and Prime Minister Walery Slawek could’ve easily resulted in another man standing in his shoes. Thankfully for Rydz-Symgly, Moscicki saw sense and engaged in an alliance, allowing for Slawek to be comfortably cast aside, into political oblivion."

 DH_POL_Colonel_Government.2.d:0 "Edward Rydz-Śmigły's rise to power left most within our government shocked at how fast he seemed to fly up the ranks. His appearance turned into one of a political juggernaut, especially with his promotion to the Marshal of Poland. The formation of the OZON movement, or the Camp of National Unity, further reinforced Rydz-Śmigły's power over the country. The OZON movement portrayed him as the next in line to lead the country, the Heir to the Second Polish Republic. The official announcement of the formation of the OZON movement came from the mouth of Adam Koc, and its aims were largely pro-military.\nAfter the death of Józef Piłsudski two years ago, Edward had attempted to unite a multitude of government factions underneath his foot, and although it failed, his supporters grew in number. A large part of these supporters he attempted to unite were the leftovers from the BBWR party, which had been clinging onto what little power they had left after the death of Józef Piłsudski. The BBWR party could no longer maintain itself and was dissolved and consequently, its remnants were absorbed by the OZON party. With this, both the OZON movement and Edward continued to grow in power."

 DH_POL_Colonel_Government.3.t:0 "Union of Young Poland"
 DH_POL_Colonel_Government.3.d:0 "The OZON movement's foundation gave rise to a highly militaristic and nationalistic right-wing party in our government, backing the takeover of the nation by the authoritarian strong-arm Edward Rydz-Śmigły, the current Marshal of Poland. The OZON's influence with the people is noticeable throughout Polish society, especially among the children. A sense of nationalism is common in one's country, but when mixed with militarism it creates a society where military service is valued as social normalcy. The OZON movement considers children as one of the tools for reshaping our society into one for a better Poland, as well as nurturing a new pure Polish Spirit.\nThe OZON seeks to praise the idea of the militarization of schools to provide the Republic with a steady stream of nationalistic children who would proudly serve and die for us. The use of this sort of indoctrination cements a mindset of the state being greater than one's self, and that one's nationalism should be backed up with loyalty to one's country, a rather mindless, zombie-like fanaticism. Strict militarization propaganda has led to such indoctrination taking place."

Our army is criminally underfunded, obsolete and will provide next to no challenge for the warmongers that are sure to come our way.\nThankfully, the Marshal has seen the deficiencies in our armed forces and has made moves to rectify the situation, but he has been held back severely by the lack of room in the budget. To prevent our rearmament efforts from stagnating, we should establish a National Defense Fund immediately.\nMade up from many sources, the money in the fund should hopefully be enough to cover the costs of rearmament and provide us with a fighting chance in the battles that are sure to come."
 DH_POL_Colonel_Government.4.A:0 "We will be ready."

 DH_POL_Colonel_Government.5.t:0 "The Death of the Marshall"
 DH_POL_Colonel_Government.5.d:0 "In the midst of a particularly tense time on the Continent, our beloved Marshal, Józef Piłsudski, has suddenly passed away this morning in Warsaw's Belweder Palace from a previously unannounced health issue. Our entire nation and peoples have entered an immediate period of mourning, recounting him as a world-renowned general and a powerful statesman. After saving the state at the Miracle on the Vistula, his title as Liberator of Poland and victor of the Polish-Soviet War shows a national savior amidst an unstable period in our history. His death may leave a lasting effect on Polish society, as his cult-like political status ascends him as a hero amongst the many citizens and nationalities of the Rzeczpospolita. Numerous condolences and services by world leaders, including the likes of [leader of the soviet union] and [leader of germany], show a level of respect, above all political differences. Even Pope Pius XI called himself "a friend of Piłsudski" and shortly held a ceremony in his honor a few days later at the League of Nations headquarters in Geneva.\nAlas, the future of the nation's political scene and status quo, lies unknown. Piłsudski's reign and supreme governmental command accidentally created a great power vacuum. While he called for a successor amongst his many past political allies, these requests seem to be falling on deaf ears. His Bezpartyjny Blok Współpracy z Rządem is absolutely leaderless and the Sanation Movement it is based on, is quickly fracturing on ideological lines. With a rumored democratic coalition rising from the lower parties, once the grief subsides, Poland will once again be thrust into political upheaval"
