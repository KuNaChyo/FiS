  DH_News.1.t:0 "Berlin-Rome Axis formalized"
  DH_News.1.d:0 "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]Shocking news from our sources in Rome and Munich today: it appears that the German Reich and the Kingdom of Italy have signed into an informal pact of friendship and a possible military alliance or Axis as they refer to, formalized by Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano. This alliance comes to a surprise towards many, considering Hitler’s unfriendly racial hierarchy towards southern Europeans, in particular, Italians, and the wide differences between Italian Fascism and the Reich’s National-Socialism, especially considering tensions between Germany and Italy over the fate of Austria and of Southern Tyrol. Of particular, this event comes as a surprise to the Western powers, who are now more threatened by a less isolated Germany, and may even begin to focus less on countering Soviet influence and more on countering far-right influence..."

  DH_News.2.d1:0 "After having brought the leaders of all major Europeans to Munich to negations regarding the Sudetenland, the glorious Führer has managed to ensure British and French endorsements for our claim on Czechoslovak territory. Because of this, we can now safely occupy the region, and if the pesky Czechoslovaks try to resist they’ll face the business end of our Wehrmacht!"
  DH_News.2.d2:0 "After a successful set of negotiations in Munich prime minister Chamberlain finally returned to the UK with promises of peace. As he stood outside the door at 10 Downing Street he was quoted saying “My good friends, for the second time in our history a British Prime Minister has returned from Germany bringing peace with honour. I believe it is peace for our time”"
  DH_News.2.d3:0 "After a successful discussion in Munich the major powers of Europe have decided that the Sudetenland should be given to Germany, to avoid a possible second world war. Despite not being represented in Munich, the Czechoslovaks are assumed to give in to the German demands."

  DH_News.4.d:0 "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]In a press conference in Berlin today, Adolf Hitler formally announced the creation of an anti-communist bloc called the Anti-Comintern Pact. This pact, aimed seemingly to counter the Communist International formed by the Soviet Union, was created to preserve and counter Communism throughout Europe and beyond. Signatories of the pact agree that they will cease the creation and ratification of any treaty involving the Soviet Union, along with providing mutual assistance in any form, from providing technical and military assistance, providing war materials, to direct intervention in any conflict that the Soviet Union and her allies committed in the signatory states. While the pact currently has no members other than the German Reich, reports from other nations suggest that a handful will accept Germany’s invitation as a means to create a united effort against Communism and World Revolution."

  DH_News.5.d:0 "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]A sad day for all Catholics across the globe, when today, after suffering a third and, sadly, fatal heart attack, Pope Pius XI, the first sovereign of the Vatican state, has passed away in his bedchambers at the Apostolic Palace. The Pope was very well known as a patron of the sciences, with a particular affinity to the radio, while his criticism against the dangers of socialism and communism would shape a generation of Catholics. Also well-known were his latest condemnations of the Third Reich in Germany, through his encyclical "Mit brennender Sorge", not long ago. A conclave to choose a new Pope is already underway. "

  DH_News.6.d:0 "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]It seems like the promises of limited independence given by the British to the Iraqis back in 1932 were not enough to quench their will for freedom of foreign rule, when, yesterday, four Iraqi Generals, colloquially known as the Golden Square, seized the state apparatus and overthrew the pro-British regent, 'Abd al-Ilah, while installing Rashid Ali al-Gaylani as the new prime minister. The middle east now watches, waiting for Britain's next move. It has not been the first time since a revolt against mandates set up by London has happened, and it might also not be the last. "
