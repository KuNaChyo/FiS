#  Finland Leaders
#########################################################################
 Pehr_Evind_Svinhufvud_desc:0 "When one thinks of a politician, one thinks of someone who serves his own interests. Either that or the interests of someone else. That usually ends up with the people suffering under the politician, and never getting the basic necessities of life.\nBut this politician is not the typical rank and file politician. Oh no, not him. He’s a unique brand of politician, one willing to throw himself for his country. You see, he saw the horrors of war, the carnage man created during the Independence War. Yet he also saw the bravery of his fellow Finn, inspiring him to do the same. He would join militia after militia, serving diligently against the Red Menace. After the war, when the Soviets degenerated into the totalitarian nightmare, he knew….\nHe was right all along.\nBut not just against the left, he was against any form of radicalism, for the country was young, and he would rather die than let it become a socialist hell hole or a fascist police state. When Mäntsälä happened, he made sure that the coup was foiled, but not through bullets, but rather through words. Those words helped to show the rebels the truth, and with just one speech, they dispersed.\nNow it has been nearly 2 decades since the country was set free from the Russian yoke, and he has something to show for it. Regent, Prime Minister, and now President. Truly, this is not your typical politician."
 Kyosti_Kallio_desc:0 "Time. It is a linear concept. Always in one direction, never changing, never being changed. So one must use it wisely, or else they will have lived a life unfulfilled.\nNot this man. Not Kyösti Kallio.\nBorn to a small family in the Duchy of Finland, this man would eventually become something more than a simple citizen, more than a politician. Instead, he would become a symbol. To the Finnish people.\nKallio would find himself in a perilous situation following the liberation of the country from Provisional Rule. Mainly, where would the country go? Would it become a socialist den of debauchery? Or would it thrive in the flames of war?\nKallio, while a member of the agrarian league, saw the destruction the Reds had done, and instead decided to use the law to suppress these maniacs. \nYet he wasn’t just a man of the law, for he was able to be president multiple times in the ’20s, managing to steer the country towards a more prosperous path.\nKallio has shown us that time can be used more efficiently, achieving many things in such a small amount of time.\nTime may be linear, but it is certainly not uneventful."
 Risto_Ryti_desc:0 "Finance, and politics. Now normally, those two things should not mix, since the times that happened resulted in less than savory results. Corruption, nepotism, and manipulation of the government to suit one’s needs. However, when the two mix in just the right way, they can produce some spectacular results.\nEnter Risto Ryti.A man who was more than a hideaway during the Independence War, he was able to rise through the government. Yet this was not because of connections, or by his political knowledge, but rather, but his acumen in finance and economics. When he was 23, he was appointed as finance minister under Juho Vennola, managing the economy with precision and efficiency.\nNothing would trump that until he became the governor of the national bank. \nThis one appointment would be his moment.\nHe managed to get the country running after Black Monday, stabilizing the economy and showing the world that Finland was not the backwater it was seen to be. Let this man be an example to all of us of the true strength of the Finnish people, and that we are not the backwater we once were!"
 Carl_Gustaf_Emil_Mannerheim_desc:0 "Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim born 4th of June 1867 was a Finnish military leader born of a German-Swedish noble family, nevertheless he was no less loyal to Finland than any other man that could trace his heritage in Finland for hundreds of years. He was a keypoint figure in the great struggle for the existence of Finland as a self-determined state born of the dying Russian Empire and defender of democratic, republican ideals in spite of the Bolshevik revolution.\n\nMannerheim was, as a young man, trained extensively in the art of warfare on horseback, in fact throughout most of his military record in the Imperial Army he fought with and lead cavalry corps, from being part of the Chevalier Guard Regiment to commanding the Guards Cavalry Brigade; Not only was he highly capable in warfare he also had extensive knowledge and experience in on-the-field intelligence-gathering and espionage after several spent in Asia undercover for the Russian government.\nThe true test of his mettle and abilities came in 1918 with the Bolshevik revolution of Russia spreading itself in the newly formed independent state of Finland, where he didn't only fight the Finnish Red Guard but also remnants of the Russian Imperial Army. Despite the initial situation of advantage for the red guard Mannerheim managed to weather it through his tactical prowess and help from the German Empire. At the end of the day, following months of bloody fighting, the war was over and Mannerheim stood victorious.\n\nDuring the inter-war years, Mannerheim did not assume any political office and did not join any political parties. Although he had his sympathies for the right-wing and did not truly believe in democracy he pursued a policy of nonpartisan often trying to reconcile the right and left-wing in order to face adversities as one nation, united.\nThis policy has borne its fruits as the public opinion of him shifted into that of a uniter and a truly neutral party amongst the bickering of the political parties and as of 1933, he became the Field Marshal of Finland. As the Red Bear rises in the East and the Black Eagle in South Finland's position seems more precarious than ever and it is no doubt that Mannerheim will fill a central role in what is to be this nation's future."

Karelia, the Kola Peninsula and Olonetsk are offered for our unconditional membership to the Axis faction. Their reason for abondoning the lands seems to evolve around the harsh winter conditions. Ah well, their problem. If we accept we are expected to function as Germany's northern flank, safeguarding the north of their new possessions in the east."

The rest of the country however remains mostly exposed. Despite the poor infrastructure and terrain of the north these areas are still poorly manned and are fertile grounds for a Soviet offensive.
