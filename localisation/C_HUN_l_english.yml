# Hungary Focuses
#########################################################################
 HUN_The_Regents_Rule:0 "The Regents Rule"
 HUN_The_Regents_Rule_desc:0 "Miklos Horthy, the greatest man on earth shall once again lead mighty Hungary. The true test of time shall show that Hungary can't be stopped by any treaty of foreign powers. After asking Miklos Horthy to return to the throne, he made several demands. Begrudgingly the Hungarian parliament has folded to the demands of the new Regent of Hungary. The great admiral shall lead from his new position in the absence of a monarch. His Serene Highness the Regent of the Kingdom of Hungary Miklos Horthy."

 HUN_Secret_Rearmament_desc:0 ""

 HUN_One_and_Indivisble:0 "One and Indivisble"
 HUN_One_and_Indivisble_desc:0 "To survive the 20th century, Hungary and Austria must adapt, they must band together, they must help each other. A problem has caught our attention. The Vaterländischen Front, ever-growing in popularity has no intentions to unite with us. They must be crushed, they must be pushed down. The Italians will undoubtedly be angered, but informing them about our cause shall clam them down. Our two countries shall be one and indivisible!"

 HUN_The_Third_Attempt:0 "The Third Attempt"
 HUN_The_Third_Attempt_desc:0 ""Once more we will try, once more will we struggle. The Hapsburgs will rule Hungary, recreating the powerful entity that once ruled most of Central Europe. Otto, the Hapsburg prince, seems the perfect candidate. We shall invite him, promising him great amount of power and territory. Austro-Hungary shall rise like a Pheonix from the ashes! Long live the Empire!""
 HUN_GER_Not_Annexed_AUS_tt:0 "§YGerman hasn't annexed Austria§!"

 HUN_The_Missing_Throne:0 "The Missing Throne"
 HUN_The_Missing_Throne_desc:0 "This regency cannot last forever. A king must come to power. Our current leader, although powerful, needs a spiritual leader which the country would fully support through good and bad. To make sure the throne is occupied as soon as possible we shall promote European solidarity and support the autonomy of our old neighbor, Austria."

 HUN_The_Plebicite:0 "The Plebicite"
 HUN_The_Plebicite_desc:0 "A plebiscite must be held! Austria must be united with us, their loyal allies and former subjects. Britain and France, the dominating powers of Europe and perhaps, the world, need to agree to this. That way no problems will arise, especially with the Germans. Austria and Hungary were destined to work together, they were destined to become a glorious nation."

 HUN_Irredentism_Is_The_Way:0 "Irredentism Is The Way"
 HUN_Irredentism_Is_The_Way_desc:0 "At last, the dark days of Trianon are finally behind us, and we can finally reclaim the rightful crown Hungarian lands that we had lost in 1920. Onwards to Glory!"
 HUN_GER_Annexed_AUS_tt:0 "§YGermany has annexed Austria§!"

 HUN_An_Army_with_a_King:0 "An Army with a King"
 HUN_An_Army_with_a_King_desc:0 "Ever since our union with Austria had come into being, we used to be the backbone of the entire army. Now is the time to show the world that our might hasn't died down - regardless if we're being shackled down by treaties"
 HUN_An_Army_with_a_King_tt:0 "§YThis will anger our neighbors and the Allies!§!"

 HUN_An_Empire_Yet_Again:0 "An Empire Yet Again"
 HUN_An_Empire_Yet_Again_desc:0 "Against all odds, we have managed it. We have revived the union. Austria-Hungary exists once more. But there is no time to rest! Although the country is back, the empire is not. In the South, the Slavs own many of our rightful territories, in the East, Transylvania is in the wrong hands. In the North, Bohemia and Galicia are required. We are going to face numerous challenges, but we shall not fail. The Austro-Hungarian Spirit lives on! Long live the Kaiser! Long Live Otto von Hapsburg!"
 
 HUN_The_Land_Beyond_The_Moutains:0 "The Land Beyond The Mountains"
 HUN_The_Land_Beyond_The_Moutains_desc:0 "The last of our rightful lands lie beyond along the Carpathians through the borders of Romania. We should seek ways to reclaim Transylvania; wherever through diplomacy or through war."
 
 HUN_Consolidate_Gombos_Legacy:0 "Consolidate Gombos Legacy"
 HUN_Consolidate_Gombos_Legacy_desc:0 "Gyula Gömbös was a military leader and hero of the Hungarian people. After fighting off the filthy French in world war one, and the communists in 1919, Hungary owes this man a proper legacy in the hearts of the populace. No more will stand idly by and watching the Habsburgs rule over Hungary with an iron fist. Hungary is a strong nation, a powerful nation. Is war in Europe inevitable again? Let Hungary be the hammer, not the anvil when the fighting comes to our doorstep."
 HUN_Consolidate_Gombos_Legacy_tt:0 "§YAutocompleted after Gyula Gömbös dies§!"

 HUN_Renew_our_Capital:0 "Reasuring our Capital"
 HUN_Renew_our_Capital_desc:0 "Large investments are needed for the overhaul of the economy. With political instability in Europe, it is important to reassure our German investors of our own stability. Growing concern over who will keep funding the Hungarian economy needs to be put to rest. With investments, the economy of mighty Hungary will see true growth. A new golden age is upon the nation."
 
 HUN_Our_Rightful_Land:0 "Our Rightful Land"
 HUN_Our_Rightful_Land_desc:0 "Greater Hungary is still in the hearts of the people. At one time, albeit with a Habsburg on the throne, Hungary had control of the vast lands around central Europe. Time is on our side. The democracies in the west have shown weakness against our German friends. This is our chance to reclaim some lost land. The land which our fathers and grandfather fought for with blood. Our rightful land, our land of dreams."
 
 HUN_Appeasing_Our_Superiors:0 "Appeasing Our Superiors"
 HUN_Appeasing_Our_Superiors_desc:0 "Growing German influence on our now shared border is a call for concern. Daranyi and Horthy are planning on drawing closer to our new neighbor. The only option for a successful Hungary is to be friendly with the expansionist Germans. The lunatic Austrian running their country can't have any reason to invade the nation of Hungary. Growing tensions between Hungary and Romania have been aided by our German friends. It is best to give them a hand in their own goals as well. At least for now."
 
 HUN_Blood_for_our_Debts:0 "Blood for our Debts"
 HUN_Blood_for_our_Debts_desc:0 "Hungary is itching to fight. With the industry now poised to fight a war, things will get rough. With so many men going to fight in the military, the construction of new factories and buildings will be hard. Military production is necessary for the front to wage war, so the workforce will be reassigned to weapons manufacturing. This will bring a new dawn after the hardships have been conquered. Join Greater Hungary in their fight today."
 
 HUN_Greater_Hungary:0 "Greater Hungary"
 HUN_Greater_Hungary_desc:0 "We are almost done. Our greatest goal has been achieved. All Hungarian people are going to be united under one banner, the one of a new country, one that will finally come to life once more, Greater Hungary! We will reclaim our last glory, we will show everyone the power of this modern state, guided by the powerful Magyar people!"
 
 HUN_A_Supportive_Alliance:0 "A Supportive Alliance"
 HUN_A_Supportive_Alliance_desc:0 "The war Germany is currently in is an immediate threat to our stability. The power vacuum that could open up if they were to lose would threaten hungarian interests. The country isn't ready for a war yet, but has a few well armed divisions that could aid the Germans in their efforts. Whatever we can provide them with for the time being will greatly solve the German question."
 
 HUN_Old_Friends_Older_Enemies:0 "Old Friends Older Enemies"
 HUN_Old_Friends_Older_Enemies_desc:0 "Germany is one of our greatest friends in Europe. Hungary must never forget that we are still an independent nation. The true strength is being able to be flexible in any situation. Germany's war is a great crusade, yet it has a chance of failing. Our old allied friends from a couple years ago might just let us join them if Germany is close to falling."
