 DH_soviet.1.d:0 "It seems that the Germans have need of raw material from Mother Russia. In return for the supply of oil and chromium we are to be granted letters of credit, with which we can buy consumer goods. This will relieve our population's needs for everyday goods, thus strengthening our legitimacy. On the flipside, it will also improve Germany's capacity to produce war material."

 DH_SOV_Stalin_Constitution.1.t:0 "History in One Stroke"
 DH_SOV_Stalin_Constitution.1.d:0 "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]Again our glorious government has moved further in achieving class equality and in furthering the interests of the hardworking workers of the Union in a single stroke, by having adopted a new Constitution.\n\nThe new “Stalin’s” Constitution will be replacing the heavily revised 1924 constitution. The new Constitution has been termed as an unprecedented step for the Soviet people, the Constitution enumerates economic rights not included in constitutions of the so-called Western “Democracies”. It has repealed restrictions on voting, abolishing the “lishentsy” category of people, and has added universal direct suffrage and the right to work. In addition, the new Constitution has recognized collective social and economic rights including the rights to work, rest and leisure, health protection, care in old age and sickness, housing, education, and cultural benefits. The new Constitution also provides for the direct election of all government bodies and their reorganization into a single, uniform system.\n\nOur General Secretary Joseph Stalin, genius of the new world, the wisest man of the epoch, the great leader of communism, has personally chaired over a special commission of 31 members in the creation of this new constitution which has already been enacted by the Congress of Soviets, which itself has been reformed into the Supreme Soviet."

 DH_SOV_Repurpose_Naval_Guns.1.d:0 "The Red Navy has recently submitted a report to the People's Commissariat of Defense of the Soviet Union, highlighting a large surplus of naval guns in the inventory. These guns, though antiquated, can easily be repurposed into land-based heavy guns, suitable for ground combat. Their large-caliber would allow their usage in demolishing enemy strong points and bunkers and can be very useful for the Red Army. And at the same time, their large size and limited mobility would create difficulties for them to keep up with the advancing Red Army. These old guns can at the same time be repurposed into permanently stationary coastal battery emplacements and can be used to create fortress cities and bases, already naval planners have created plans to emplace these guns, with particular plans for Sevastopol, which can easily be turned into an impenetrable fortress."

 DH_SOV_Transpolar_Flight.1.d:0 "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]Yesterday, June 20, 1937, a specially outfitted Soviet ANT-25 landed in Vancouver in the United States of America, completing the first-ever transpolar airplane flight. It flew from the Soviet Union to the United States across the North Pole, the aircraft being piloted by our very own falcons - pilot Valery Chkalov, co-pilot Georgy Baidukov, and navigator Alexander Belyakov.\n\nLong and careful preparations were made for the flight, as a forced landing in the Polar Regions would mean certain death for the entire crew, after taking off the first 24 hours of the trans-polar flight proved to be routine and uneventful, but the remainder of the long flight would test the mettle of the Soviet Union’s elite flyers. As the flight neared the Polar Regions, the aircraft’s magnetic compass became inoperable; navigation had to rely solely on dead reckoning and a solar heading indicator, with corrections made by regular sun and star observations. But Despite all the odds, the flight landed at Vancouver's Pearson Airfield successfully after a flight of 63 hours and 16 minutes and were welcomed as heroes.\n\nWhile they do a nation-wide tour of the United States, which includes a meeting with President Roosevelt and a parade in New York City, the people at home desperately await to welcome the heroes."

They were flying a specially outfitted ANT 25 and were tasked with attempting the world's first-ever transpolar flight. Prior to their unfortunate disappearance, Chkalov reported that all instruments were functioning properly and that his crew was in good condition, which has raised questions about their disappearance. The last sighting of the aircraft was near the 75th parallel.\n\nDue to the highly secretive nature of the mission, Canadian and American authorities were not informed, but there will be no need to tell them now. We have already sent planes into the air to search the area for Chkalov and his crew, however, the chances of finding them are quite low.\n\nTo avoid any trouble, Comrade Stalin has ordered the covering up of all records related to the flight and its fate.

 DH_SOV_Liquidate_The_Church.1.d:0 "The Orthodox Church has wielded considerable influence over the citizenry of our country, this influence especially prevailed during the time of the rotten Tsars, it was greatly reduced after our glorious revolution, but it still continues and persists in large parts of the society.\n\nThe State has decided, in accordance with its official mandate of state atheism or “Gosatzeism” to launch a new wave of attacks at the Church, aimed at eliminating or greatly curbing the influence of the Orthodox Church in the Soviet Society.\n\nWe can launch widespread raids, these would include confiscating Church property, deporting the church clergy, and conduct lynchings of the “believers“. This will create some apprehension in the society, on the other hand, a softer and longer but more effective way would be to initiate a cultural program where the tenets of “Socialist Science” will be promoted along with “Gostazeism”, the stigma faced by religious Christians in the society as a whole and in terms of their professional life will in most likelihood commit many to denounce the Orthodox Church, and fully integrate themselves into the Soviet society."

 DH_SOV_Introduce_Childcare.1.t:0 "A New Step for Women in the USSR"
 DH_SOV_Introduce_Childcare.1.d:0 "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]Though the Soviet state had established women equal in all spheres and walks of life since the revolution, in reality, due to limited economic independence, their individuality remained dependent on men.\n\nThe state has long looked at women as an untapped labor force, which even the most western countries shy away from. In a bid to strengthen the women and encourage greater participation in the industrialization program sweeping through the country, the state has instituted a massive childcare system, whose facilities will be available to all working mothers at a highly subsidized rate.\n\nThis progressive move has left many foreign commentators in awe, some who have long criticized the Soviet Union as highly repressive have been left speechless, while others are reporting how other countries, especially the “Democratic” ones should take a look at the Soviet system, which has come a long way in combating societal inequalities."
 DH_SOV_Introduce_Childcare.1.A:0 "We applaude these progressive reforms"

 DH_SOV_Russification.1.t:0 "Russification of the USSR"
 DH_SOV_Russification.1.d:0 "Primus inter pares\n\nOur great nation,the home of the great revolution, consists of several smaller and some larger republics. Despite attempts in the early 20s during the “Korenizatsiya” policy to encourage representation of individuals from each republic in the Soviet system and usage of native languages, the Russians have continued to dominate the Soviet society, and it is clear that they will continue to do so. The Soviet Union needs to become a singular entity and needs to be based around a single culture, the Russian culture, even many in the higher echelons of the party leadership are Russified individuals and native Russians.\n\nThough not officially “superior”, the state directive will be simply that among the equal republics of the great Union, the Russian Republic is “more equal”. With a single language, there would be better functioning of the state, better coordination with local administrations, and in the army, Regional units would be able to coordinate in a more effective manner. A common culture would enable and foster camaraderie between the people, all the way from the workers in Vladivostok to the workers in Baku."

 #### The Great Purge Events
 DH_SOV_Great_Purge.1.t:0 "The Yagoda Proposal"
 DH_SOV_Great_Purge.1.d:0 "NKVD chief Genrikh Yagoda has submitted to the Politburo, earlier today, a rather controversial proposal. Within he suggests the complete and utter removal of the Trotskyist influence, which still haunts the USSR to this day, via the method of "remote camps". Quite obviously, this has caused outrage from both the Right Opposition and those within the Politburo who still sympathize with the theories of Trotsky. Hard-line communists already appear to be leaning in support of Yagoda's radical plans. Whatever happens, it is clear the party is still open to infighting and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future unless decisive action is taken."
 DH_SOV_Great_Purge.1.A:0 "We must fend off all threats of the revolution!"

 DH_SOV_Great_Purge.2.t:0 "Proposal Approved by the Politburo"
 DH_SOV_Great_Purge.2.d:0 "NKVD chief Genrikh Yagoda submitted a proposal to the Politburo for sending "all the Trotskyists" into the "remote camps"... Under Comrade Stalin’s order, Trotsky was been taken from Power, expelled from the party and exiled. The threat of an uprising against the state, however, must be preemptively shut down by excluding the Trotskyites from our society to camps far, far away, in order to ensure a peaceful people within Russian borders. With the Politburo now on board, all the USSR shall be freed from Trotskyist influence."
 DH_SOV_Great_Purge.2.A:0 "Stalin's leadership must be secured!"

 DH_SOV_Moscow_Trials.1.t:0 "Trial of the Sixteen"
 DH_SOV_Moscow_Trials.1.d:0 "The trial of the Sixteen, the first of what will be many of these trials, marks the beginning of a new age in Soviet politics. A cleansing, of sorts, as we rid ourselves of the corrupt and Trotskyist influences within our government. Sometimes it is better to amputate the limb, rather than let the gangrene fester and spread until the whole body is engulfed and destroyed. We have decided to take similar measures in the purging of many Soviet politicians. Although through the use of show trials, their guilt on the actions they are accused of may be questionable, they are undoubtedly a corrupting source within our administration. In the October house of unions in Moscow, sixteen individuals who had been suspected of a plethora of crimes, ranging from terrorism to plotting an assassination on Joseph Stalin, were found guilty of all charges. They were promptly sentenced to death and subsequently brought to the cellars of Lubyanka Prison were they each had a bullet put through their skulls. Prominent members of the sixteen executed individuals include Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev and whilst their absence leaves a hole in our political governance, their deaths mark the beginning of a greater struggle for purity within the USSR."
 DH_SOV_Moscow_Trials.1.A:0 "Sometimes it is better to amputate the limb"

 DH_SOV_Moscow_Trials.2.t:0 "Trial of the Sixteen"
 DH_SOV_Moscow_Trials.2.d:0 "Second of the so-called ‘Moscow Trials’, the trial of the Anti-Soviet Trotskyist Centre involves the persecution of seventeen politicians, including figures such as Karl Radek. Whilst thirteen of the initial suspects were taken away and shot immediately, we have decided it best to spare several of the implicated traitors including Radek. Radek has provided us with useful information, particularly in regards to the potential treachery of many other prominent politicians and generals, including Bukharin and Tukhachevsky. Whilst the trial itself may not have been as significant as the last, it sets the stage for important later trials that will take place. The implications of Radek have made it clear that the military, along with many other political sections, is not to be trusted. We will see to them in the future. As for Radek, a labor camp seems the appropriate response, considering the information he has provided. We will dispose of him at a later date."
 DH_SOV_Moscow_Trials.2.A:0 "Are we safe from the Counter-Revolutionaries?"

 DH_SOV_Moscow_Trials.3.t:0 "Trial of the Anti-Soviet Military Organization"
 DH_SOV_Moscow_Trials.3.d:0 "We have found out that more of our "loyal" generals and officers are secretly avid supporters of the traitor that is Leon Trotsky!\nThis cannot be, they must be trialed and hopefully, executed. The treacherous back-stabbers include Yakov Alksnis, Konstantin Rokossovsky, Yelisey Goryachev, Vasili Ulrikh and even Mikhail Tukhachevsky, who has been charged with the creation of a Right-Wing Trotskyist miltary conspiracy. We have to make sure that none can question Joseph Stalin's authority and that no one will ever think of replacing him."
 DH_SOV_Moscow_Trials.3.A:0 "Tukhachevsky must be tried in secret and executed immediately!"
 DH_SOV_Moscow_Trials.3.B:0 "Rokossovsky refuses to confess, but cannot be allowed to live!"

 DH_SOV_Moscow_Trials.4.t:0 "Trial of the Twenty-One"
 DH_SOV_Moscow_Trials.4.d:0 "The third show trial, which commenced earlier this month, tied together all the loose threads from earlier trials. It includes 21 defendants alleged to belong to the so-called " Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites". As part of the great purge, an overwhelmingly saddening task necessary to ensure loyalty to our motherland, the Trial of the Twenty-One will finish our struggle with the defiant upper class. Ambassadors, heads of mighty organizations and plain doctors alike will fall by our hand, doth they betrayed our motherland!"
 DH_SOV_Moscow_Trials.4.A:0 "The navy and air force have been getting off easy so far."
 DH_SOV_Moscow_Trials.4.B:0 "As we suspected, enemies are everywhere!"

 DH_SOV_Leningrad_Circle.1.t:0 "The Meeting"
 DH_SOV_Leningrad_Circle.1.d:0 "“But that's not in the spirit of the revolution that Comrade Lenin wanted” said one of the Red Army Generals present in the meeting, “Well Comrade Lenin sure as hell didn't want Stalin in power”, said Marshal Tukhachevsky.\n\nThe group of Generals all held some of the most important ranks in the Red Army, each of the Military districts had at least one officer or more representing them in this meeting, on their orders the entire Red Army could be mobilized immediately for war or for any other “purpose”.\n\nMarshal Tukhachevsky ranted on how political interference had prevented him from capturing Warsaw in 1920, with many other officers also concurring and lamenting how almost daily interference by Political Commissars and their authority to countermand unit officer’s orders prevents them from doing something as trivial as regular shooting practices. A relatively junior officer from the Volga Military District pointed out how the Red Army’s leadership is being culled of the so-called “Trotskyites” and has made many of the commanders fearful of their lives, as executions and dismissals have become almost regular. After several hours of discussion, the officers dispersed, promising to meet again soon."
 DH_SOV_Leningrad_Circle.1.A:0 "Lenin's Legacy will no longer be tarnished!"

 DH_SOV_Leningrad_Circle.2.t:0 "Tukachevsky's Secret Speech"
 DH_SOV_Leningrad_Circle.2.d:0 "Every single of these “Secret Meetings” has ended with the officers agreeing on nothing, with none of them ready to take any decisive action. However, this meeting was different.\n\n“They killed all of my sons and nephews, that Pig Stalin himself handed me their “confession letters, still damp with their own blood,” said one of the Generals. Many in the meeting had been serving since the Civil War, begging for reforms of any kind, but were deeply disappointed with the party apparatus' inaction. These Reformists held most of the sway in these meetings, and their support was necessary if anything substantial was to come out of these meetings. Marshal Tukhachevsky, often the most vocal in these meetings, began by expressing his dissatisfaction with the lack of action that had been taken, lamenting over how even Comrade Lenin’s closest associates had not been spared in the ongoing violent purge, and how only the “removal” of Stalin could stop the madness. Many were visibly aghast at the word “removal” but encouraged by the “Ayes” of the others, specifically the Reformists, Tukhachevsky resumed by enumerating that the purge would never end, possibly until he himself got shot. He only ended when the desk tapping had become so loud that even he could not hear his own words."
 DH_SOV_Leningrad_Circle.2.A:0 "Cowards die many times before their deaths, but the valiant never taste death, but once"

 DH_SOV_Leningrad_Circle.3.t:0 "March on the Kremlin"
 DH_SOV_Leningrad_Circle.3.d:0 "After cutting all the landlines going out of Moscow, Tukhachevsky’s troops from the Leningrad Military district poured into the city. Soon the guards at the Kremlin were overpowered without any significant struggle, save for a couple of firefights. The Marshal personally entered the Kremlin with a detachment of troops to arrest Stalin and other Party members present in the Kremlin.\n\nMarshal Tukhachevsky leading a group of officers kicked down the door of Stalin’s personal office in the Kremlin Senate to find him hiding behind his desk, he motioned his adjutant to arrest him, Stalin spat all manners of abuses and threats while being lifted and handcuffed.\n\nInitially thought to be a Coup involving only a few Red Army units, it’s full scope and extent was soon revealed when later in the evening several cars entered Moscow with Red Army officers from the surrounding military districts, “escorting” Politburo members that had not been present in the City earlier in the day.\n\nThe nearly bloodless coup has been largely successful. Already proceedings have begun in a special court set up in Moscow, headed by the Marshal himself to sentence the “Traitors” of the Union."
 DH_SOV_Leningrad_Circle.3.A:0 "There's no turning back now..."

 DH_SOV_Leningrad_Circle.4.t:0 "Civil War!"
 DH_SOV_Leningrad_Circle.4.d:0 "After severing all lines of communication to and from Moscow, thousands of troops from the Leningrad Military District poured all over the city, establishing checkpoints and perimeters all over the city, most sites of the governmental and key locations being quickly secured, but at the Kremlin, there were short but intense firefights, the outnumbered guards being constantly ordered to stand their ground by Joseph Stalin who had barricaded himself in the office.\n\nAfter subduing the guards, Marshal Tukhachevsky and his top aides made their way to Stalin’s office, and dragged the General Secretary out, who was cowardly hiding behind his desk, initially hurling abuses defiantly, he soon began to sob helplessly. His desperate pleas were being constantly interrupted by punches, kicks and his own crying and sobbing, after reaching the Red Square, he was thrown face down onto the pavement, breaking his nose, and causing his blood to stain the brick. Not long after, a truck arrived, carrying fifteen of the most senior NKVD officials that had been present at the Lubyanka building, which had surrendered almost immediately after realizing the overwhelming number of the Army troops.\n\nFollowing an improvised proceeding in the middle of the nearly empty Red Square, the Marshal sentenced Stalin and the NKVD personnel, sixteen men who represented a symbolic reprisal for the sixteen who had been “convicted” at the start of the Purge. Stalin, who had crawled like an infant in the ground, was still wailing and was forced to get on his knees, with the others. Tukhachevsky then took out his own service weapon to shoot each of the 16 while pausing in between to reload. Within minutes there were 16 lifeless bodies slumped in the Red Square, bodies of “traitors” as the Marshal’s adjutant wrote in his official report."

 #### Politburo Weakened Events
 DH_SOV_Politburo_Weakened.1.t:0 "Rise of the Stalin Opposition"
 DH_SOV_Politburo_Weakened.1.d:0 "The Politics and the leadership of our great Union both have had peculiar histories, expected to lead a global revolution, the untimely death of our Country’s founding father brought much sorrow to our country. After Lenin’s death, a "troika" consisting of Grigory Zinoviev of the Ukrainian SSR, Lev Kamenev of the Russian SFSR, and Joseph Stalin of the Transcaucasian SFSR led the nation after a brief struggle against Leon Trotsky and his supporters, with the power being eventually consolidated under the seat of the incumbent General Secretary Joseph Stalin.\n\nThough seemingly a powerful and strong figure to some, the leader has had his fair share of failings - a debatable involvement in the eventual disaster in the Polish campaign, destructive attitudes in fulfilling his policies of industrialization and collectivization that have killed many and even generated famines, it is alleged that even the founding father, Lenin in his last days was concerned about Stalin and had tried to facilitate his dismissal to prevent his future involvement in the government’s policies.\n\nMuch of the critique against him has generally been random and unorganized, but finally and for the greater good, unfounded as well as founded accounts indicate that the dissension against him has been consolidated and is now organized among and with the patronage of some high ranking Politburo members. Though the extent and scope is not fully known, it has become quite evident that opposition against Stalin and his policies is starting to manifest and has become indicative to other Party members as well."

 DH_SOV_Politburo_Weakened.2.d:0 "After much ramblings, uncertainties, and intrigue in the higher echelons of the political structure and leadership of the Soviet Union, it has become quite evident that the “Opposition” has consolidated itself and has a more than significant presence in the party circles.\n\nSeveral members of the Politburo, who are not supposed to give in to “factionalism” have made their intentions clear, and indicated that they will do everything in their power to remove General Secretary Stalin, this development has effectively led to the de-facto creation of an anti-Stalinist power bloc. \n\nThough not with certainty, it is widely believed that the oppositionists themselves are divided into their own sections, it is suspected that there are 3 main constituents, Nikolai Bukharin, leading the right-leaning members, highly improbable but rumored Sergei Kirov from the Party Center, and insignificant yet present Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev who lead the left elements. Kamenev and Zinoviev have long been considered as Stalin rivals and even Nikolai Bukharin’s disagreements with the General Secretary regarding the decision of collectivization, which led to millions of deaths and his subsequent drifting away from Stalin all indicate their possible involvement in the “Opposition”. But the rumors about Sergei Kirov’s involvement, which some think to be absurd are the real shockers considering his personal relationship with the General Secretary, though seemingly improbable, he is an influential member and commands enough respect to even refuse Stalin’s directives, whatever the case maybe it remains clear for any action to be taken against Stalin by the politburo, all the sections will play decisive roles, especially with the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party coming up, which will elect the Central Committee."

In his speech he highlighted his achievements and his work for the socialist cause, enumerating his “contribution” to the society by mentioning the recently completed first five-year plan and his collectivization policies, at that moment there was a snide remark by a party member “Millions Dead, seem to be a good enough contribution to the cause”, Stalin was confounded by such a brazen disrespect of his authority, and with no opposition from any other party members, the full scope of the “Opposition” became evident.\n\nAfter fumbling, never used to such an interruption Stalin continued albeit now with less clarity and proceeded with further attacks against his critics, accusing them of being agents of Trotsky attempting to bring down the State from within to fulfill the nefarious goals of anti-revolutionaries. Despite some cheers and approvals from some of the Stalinist supporters, the indifferent attitudes and rhetorics by many clearly indicated that the General Secretary had lost a large amount of approval, which would in all cases be evident and manifest in the upcoming 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party."

 DH_SOV_XVII_Congress.1.t:0 "First day of the 17th Congress"
 DH_SOV_XVII_Congress.1.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]It is another historic event here today in the capital Moscow, for revolutionaries from all sides of the political aisle have gathered here today to convene the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party. \n\nAttended by more than a thousand delegates who have been handpicked to proactively and pragmatically represent the many sectors and party members in the Communist Party, this Congress will discuss a wide variety of issues from Party Organization Reform to the status of the brilliant Five Year Plan which has brought unprecedented levels of prosperity never before seen in Russia in history, along with electing various of our comrades into the important organs of the Party.\n\nThis is a historic day, whose deliberations and decisions shall shape our glorious Union forever!"

 DH_SOV_XVII_Congress.2.d:0 "“Comrades, more than three years have passed since the Sixteenth Congress. That is not a very long period. But it has been fuller in content than any other period- I do not think that any period in the last decade has been so rich in events like this one.”\n\nStalin's report centers on three main areas:\n-The great depression ravaging the capitalist world, which is unprecedented in its length and severity. In contrast to this, the USSR's production has more than doubled,\nclearly showing the superiority of the socialist model.\n-The growing tensions between the European powers, and between Japan and China, which threaten to plunge the world into war once more.\n-Soviet diplomatic relations with the rest of the world, which have improved greatly with the signing of nonaggression pacts with Poland, Finland, Italy, and France. Relations have been restored with the United States and China as they see our increasing economic and military might.\n\nAs the speech comes to an end, applause can be heard ringing throughout the congress chambers- even some members of Nikolai Bukharin's right opposition can be seen clapping and cheering. As the applause dies down, the General Secretary makes one last remark..."

 DH_SOV_XVII_Congress.3.d:0 "We expected today a rejection of blame from the party- what we did not expect was that they would accept the criticism, and that is what has come to pass.\nThe party is not monolithic, and there is always dissent, but on most occasions, a compromise is made and a decision announced. Stalin's harsh criticism of the party hasn't made him any new friends, but it seems enough of the politburo to see the truth in Stalin's criticisms to make a statement. However, by carefully examining the reactions of the politburo members, a deeper truth can be found. It seems that the decision to accept culpability for what many see as Stalin's failures was hotly contested behind closed doors and that a large bloc of the politburo does not agree with their peers. Going forward, this split will likely affect the politburo's decision making for the rest of the congress, if not longer. A delegate to the left whispers ominously.\n\n“What was it that American President said?”"
 DH_SOV_XVII_Congress.3.A:0 "The Party will betray the revolution nevermore."

 DH_SOV_XVII_Congress.4.t:0 "The Members did not Accept Criticisms"
 DH_SOV_XVII_Congress.4.d:0 "After Comrade Stalin put forth fierce criticism of the CPSU and its members in his reports about the general state of the Union, many were quick to disregard these accusations as outrageous and the specific problems as “blown out of proportion“ and “not representative for the state of the Union and Revolution“. And while many party members were content with these statements, fine with the reassuring pat on their back put forth by their fellow comrades, there were others who were deeply affected by Comrade Stalin's reports.\nWhat did the party truly achieve from the start of the Revolution?\nTrue they won the war against the Reactionaries but after that? The dream of the world revolution died before Warsaw, the dream of eternal prosperity died with the plethora of international sanctions and the revolutionary spirit of 1917 drowned in a sea of misery and war. The dream of the communist utopia simply vanished in the face of the cold reality.  But who could be blamed? The farmer who toils in the fields to prevent another famine from plaguing the country? The factory worker who works long hours in the factories to ensure that the Union is on par with the capitalist countries? \nThe soldiers, who are ready to give their blood and lives to keep the revolution going? No, they can´t be blamed, for they still give everything for the Revolution.  Soon the delegates realized that only the party can be blamed and that only they can correct the mistakes they made, that improvement is needed to rekindle the flame of the Revolution. And improve they will, for only the party will be able to guide the proletariat towards utopia"

 DH_SOV_XVII_Congress.5.d:0 "Next on our agenda is a speech from Vyacheslav Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, and Valerian Kuybyshev, Chairman of the State Planning Committee, on the necessity of a second 5-year plan. While the first 5-year plan overhauled agriculture in the union, seeing state-enforced collectivization, the "liquidation" of the Kulaks, and the construction of a foundation for heavy industry, it did not fully meet all of its goals- greatest of them a full transition of the economy to socialism. Molotov and Kuybyshev propose a second 5-year plan that will achieve the remaining uncompleted objectives of the first, as well as create further heavy industry and infrastructure. Both Molotov and Kuybyshev are close allies of Stalin's, and going through with the plan will greatly increase the General Secretary's power over the state and economy. On the other hand, as many of the delegates have observed, the first 5-year plan's successes came at a cost and even so weren't entirely successful."

 DH_SOV_XVII_Congress.6.d:0 "To be a card-carrying member of the party no longer means what it used to, and Lazar Kaganovich has come before the politburo to tell us of what can be done. Since the Bolsheviks under Lenin seized the apparatus of the state, party membership has become more and more necessary for everyday life in the union. As such, membership has exploded, and many of these new members are... less than dedicated to our goals. Kaganovich suggests that we extend party membership only to those who have proven themselves through work in a social organization, and increase the number of recommendations required to join. Finally, Kaganovich proposes that we replace the current Rabkrin, the committee designed to expose corruption and government wrongdoing, with a new People's Control Commission dedicated to the oversight of the many oblasts, krais and autonomous republics of the Union."

 DH_SOV_XVII_Congress.7.d:0 "At last, the most important issue on our agenda is the matter of elections to the party's Central Committee. The Politburo will stay largely the same as it is now, with only one position changing hands, but the Secretariat will see radical change, with a majority of its members being replaced. Despite all these changes, most delegates expect Josef Stalin to retain the post of General Secretary. However, perhaps there is one who could challenge Stalin for leadership- Sergei Kirov. Kirov has always had the support of a wide swathe of the party and has started to drift away from Stalinism, exerting more and more independence from Moscow every day. Perhaps Stalin's ten-year rule will soon come to an end."

 DH_SOV_XVII_Congress.8.d:0 "The early votes have come in, and they paint a grim picture for Stalin's continued leadership. The party leadership uses a voting system where candidates are voted against, and the candidate with the fewest votes against takes the position- Stalin has already received a significant amount of those votes. What might have been unthinkable a few years ago now presents itself as a tantalizing opportunity- the removal of General Secretary Joseph Stalin? Much of the party has always hated the old enforcer, some even claiming Lenin tried to prevent Stalin's leadership from his deathbed, but they have never had a good way to oust him- until now. In dim backrooms and hotel rooms, a plot is beginning to coalesce. They can get the votes, all they need now is a candidate to take the General Secretaryship, and they already have someone in mind. Though once a Stalin ally, he has slowly drifted away from Stalin in recent years, preferring vibrant St. Petersburg to the halls of power in Moscow."

The unlucky aide looks out over the crowd, visibly shaken, and speaks so quickly it's hard to understand his words. "The party has decided that to maintain strong leadership in this time of crisis, comrades Kirov, Molotov, and Kalinin will form a provisional government." The chambers are silent for a moment before they explode into activity, a tsunami of sound washing over the seated crowd. Delegates scramble across the floor for hurried discussions with their friends and allies.\n“This is unprecedented!”\n“Is that legal? Can they do that?”\n“At least Kirov's on the provisional government.”\n“Now this is why we should have voted for Stalin.”\n\nAfter a time, the discussion dies down, and the new troika, reminiscent of the triumvirates of Rome, will begin their work to lead and protect the revolution."

Bukharin slowly walks up to the front of the room, and every single footstep can be heard echoing through the vast emptiness of the congregation hall. As the old revolutionary takes the podium, every single eye is fixed on him, scanning, searching for any clue for his next words.\nComrade Bukharin smiles and humbly accepts the monumental task of leading the revolution in these most perilous of times.\nWhen our Union is threatened, when the reactionaries circle like hungry wolves around us, Bukharin will do everything to protect the revolution, our revolution, from those who would crush the workers under their boot."

Sergei Kirov lacked the will and determination to our glorious cause and he shall be remembered as a loser against comrade Stalin and shall be forgotten by history. Our comrade Stalin certainly lacked neither the will nor the determination to The Motherland, he knows what it takes to be a true member of The Party.

Kirov says the traitors offered him the post of General Secretary upon ousting comrade Stalin, but he immediately refused and went straight to Stalin to report the plot. While the plot has been foiled, for now, this incident has shown that dissent does exist in the highest echelons of the party. Worse still, the dissenters are bold enough to go about their plotting right under the General Secretary's nose. Bukharin is safe, for now, but it may be wise for him to find other allies."

A party functionary calls the congress to a close with what might have been a small sigh of relief, and the event is finally over. The assembly begins to shuffle out of the congress chambers and down the halls, dog tired.\nAll the delegates are happy to return home to their wives and families at long last, and some prepare for a long journey to the furthest corners of the Union in the Caucasus and far east.\n\nAfter weeks of constant cacophony, the Kremlin finally falls silent.\n\nDecisions made these two weeks will guide the course of both the Soviet Union and the international socialist revolution for years to come, and will surely change the world as well.

The meeting has been labeled as the "Congress of Victors" to mark the success of the first five-year plan and the collectivization of agriculture.\n\nApart from the main agendas discussed by the body, the composition of the Central Committee was also elected, and to the shock of many, the Congress voted out the current General Secretary, Joseph Stalin with well over one hundred votes against him.\n\nSergei Kirov, a very prominent politician, part of the “Old Guard ” and a personal friend of Joseph Stalin himself has been elected as the new General Secretary and will be heading a Troika comprising of Party veterans Vyacheslav Molotov and Mikhail Kalinin as the leaders of the Central Committee. Kirov, the current head of the Communist Party in Leningrad only received 3 votes against. His ideas are well known in the party, a strong supporter of industrialization and collectivization in the Country, it is widely believed in the country that the new General Secretary will bring much glory to the Worker’s cause."

But instead, the highlight has been the formation of a “Provisional Government”, headed by long time party member Nikolai Bukharin.\n\nThe current General Secretary Joseph Stalin received more than 100 votes against him for the Central Committee elections, making it evident that it was impossible for him to be elected in the face of such great opposition from Party ranks. A staunch proponent of the New economic policy during the early 1920s, many are scratching their heads, trying to predict the direction in which Comrade Bukharin will steer the nation to, but rest assured the people of the glorious Soviet Union will continue to thrive under his guiding hand."

Our Premier even said, "What fool will sell us his secrets?" However, despite his doubts, the British allowed the license for them and the technical blueprints when we approached them on this matter. Soon, the engines were reverse-engineered and adapted for our needs and renamed the Klimov RD-45. With this new engine being produced, we assigned the project of using it to design a jet-powered interceptor to the Mikoyan-Gurevich OKB. We even supplied them with other foreign models to incorporate into the design. The result? An effective, fast interceptor to catch and destroy enemy bombers daring to bomb Soviet soil. 2 23 mm Nudelman-Rikhter NR-23 autocannons and a 37 mm Nudelman N-37 autocannon shred enemy planes and send them burning to the ground.

As the general demographics in the Soviet Union are becoming more and more imbalanced due to our previous 'troubles' both in the Homefront and the multiple conflicts we faced abroad, we can not allow ourselves to sacrifice waves of young Soviet men anymore. That is why we have conceived a new type of armored vehicle, our brave engineers at Zavod simply called it the 'armored transporter' ... well ... although the name isn't inspiring, this armored vehicle will allow us to drop our troops directly on the battlefield and support them on the long term allowing us to limit casualties and seize any objectives at lighting speed!"

However, we had always lacked the engines needed to provide these heavy fighters with sufficient performance. As soon as we developed these engines, we decided the first step to obtaining heavy fighters was to have them designed by the Central Design Bureau. Sergey Ilyushin and his skilled team of engineers have created the TsKB-55. We awarded it the VVS designation BSh-2, but our hopes were dashed - it underperformed in combat situations because of its weight, which was more than it could carry. Because of this, it was redesigned as the TsKB-57, a lighter single-seat design, which passed the Acceptance Trials and was baptized as the Il-2. This new heavy fighter has overcome the limitations of its predecessor and proved capable for actual combat missions. Its maximum speed of 414 km/h will allow it to dash past its competitors, and its range of 720 km will allow it to perform longer missions.

The Tupolev OKB was assigned to cloning and reverse-engineering these models, and they have had success. However, difficulties have arisen; for example, the imperial system, which is rarely used, is employed to determine the thickness of its armor plating. Even if this issue seems easy to fix, converting the measurements into our superior metric system has proven troublesome. Despite these drawbacks, our TU-4 only weighs about 340 kg more than its American counterpart. With a maximum speed of 558 km/h at 10,250 m of height, 5,400 km of range, the ability to hold 6 x 1,000 kg bombs, and an offensive armament of 10 × 23 mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 aircraft cannons and 2 x KS-1 Komet standoff missiles, it is truly a technological marvel.

This will enable our economy to outpace the capitalists, no matter how hard they ride the oppressed within their borders, and create a true, communist economy."

Lenin understood that to achieve true socialism, one must first have capitalism to provide the base (which can later be removed.) Joseph Stalin abolished this policy in 1928. However, we have decided a return to the NEP is required, given the slow movement of our government away from authoritarianism, and it should be put in place soon.

Factories and industrial centers shall be made, along with acquisitioning huge tracts of land for government purposes, such as refineries and extraction facilities, to ensure Baku’s survival. If Baku falls, the Union falls."

 SOV_Reverse_Korenizatsiya:0 "Reverse Korenizatsiya"
 SOV_Reverse_Korenizatsiya_desc:0 "In our effort to homogenize the national identity of the Union, we have come across a rather difficult stumbling block; the deep integration of local officials into the governments of our constituent republics. This is the product of the Korenizatsiya program, a sadly misguided idea engendered by none other than Stalin himself that aimed to put greater powers in the hands of regional peoples.\n\nHowever, in this day and age, we can no longer allow such diversity in government. This only causes strife in legislating laws to emancipate our citizens. Therefore, we must root out nationalists in the ranks of these administrations and replace them with pure-blooded, loyal Slavs who will serve the ethnic peoples far better than they themselves could."

 SOV_Formalize_Southern_Industries:0 "Formalize Southern Industries"
 SOV_Formalize_Southern_Industries_desc:0 "While the more centrally located areas of our Union developed splendidly during the First and Second Year Plan, it has not gone unnoticed to the general population that the Area around Stalingrad and the Kaukasus Mountains, has remained untouched by our industrialization.\n\nTo correct this minor inconvenience, we have ordered that special funding and investment should be put on these areas to ensure that they are on the same level of industrialization than the rest of the country. Soon new factories, oil wells and roads will be built, that will ensure that every area of the country can experience the prosperity provided by the Five Year Plans."

 SOV_Amplify_Agricultural_Export:0 "Amplify Agricultural Export"
 SOV_Amplify_Agricultural_Export_desc:0 "The vast, rich lands of our glorious Union have the potential to feed every starved worker, every impoverished victim of capitalism who is lucky enough to reach our shores. The great agricultural breadbaskets of Ukraine and Russia bring plenty to our citizens, ensuring that no one goes hungry.\n\nWith recent advancements in farming technology, our loyal farmers can reap twice the amount of crops, many of which are no longer needed for our own people. Instead, our advisors tell us that we could export the surplus abroad, a idea that could both put bread in the hands of workers suffering in the West and bring in raw materials upon which the our people rely."

 SOV_Stalinist_Mega_Monuments:0 "Stalinist Mega Monuments"
 SOV_Stalinist_Mega_Monuments_desc:0 "Comrade Stalin’s revolutionary philosophy, dubbed Stalinism by his many admirers and followers, must remain the core of our state, both in mind and spirit. It must remain immortal, far past his death, in the hearts of our people, in order to maintain his dream of true socialism in our homeland.\n\nTherefore, we will build monuments to our great leader across the immense lands that he has saved from reactionaries and traitors, thus reminding the workers protected by the Union whom exactly they can accredit their liberation to, and whose philosophy they should forever follow."

 SOV_Adopt_New_Russification_Policies:0 "Adopt New Russification Policies"
 SOV_Adopt_New_Russification_Policies_desc:0 "The Union must be, above all else, united. This cannot be realized when minorities across our republics still have unique identities. Their nationalism will cause only strife, building walls between our people, keeping them separate without cohesive Soviet pride.\n\nIn that mind, the Politburo has decided to resume the practices of Tsarist Russia, however difficult that may be, by reintroducing Russification. Our agents will work tirelessly to break nationalism in our constituent republics and promote instead a collective, Russian identity and devotion to the Union."

 SOV_Portray_a_Global_Soviet_Image:0 "Portray a Global Soviet Image"
 SOV_Portray_a_Global_Soviet_Image_desc:0 "At home, our people love the Union, worshipping at the pedestal of true communism. Our regime’s support has never been stronger among the common Russian. But abroad, workers who might be rallied to our cause are distrustful of us, beguiled by Western propaganda depicting us as an authoritarian, repressive dictatorship. This cannot stand.\n\nWe will begin a new campaign of propaganda, this time focusing on creating a global image of the Soviet Union as a worker’s state, the home of a revolution that will eventually sweep over the whole of Europe. We must win over the common folk so that they might join us to drive out the feeble, parasitic stain of capitalism."

 SOV_The_Great_Soviet_Famine:0 "The Great Soviet Famine"
 SOV_The_Great_Soviet_Famine_desc:0 "Even though the Politburo tries to push the current problems out of the public eye, it is an open secret that the collective efforts of the CPSU in both Ukraine and Kasachztan have led to massive famines ravaging the SSRs and its population, even though both areas are commonly known as the “breadbasket of the Union“.  Experts have already handed over several secret reports to Moscow, that predict that “if the problems regarding the agricultural sector of both the Kazakh and Ukrainian SSRs are not solved with utmost urgency, these areas will lose approximately 25 to 40% of their population, 75% of their livestock, 40% of their economic potential and their remaining loyalty to both the Soviet Union and the guidance of comrade Stalin.“ So far the leadership of the Soviet Union hasn't formulated a plan in combatting the critical situation, but it is clear that something must be done to prevent the Ukrainian and Kazakh workers from abandoning the Union."

 SOV_Aftermath_of_the_Ryutin_Affair:0 "Aftermath of the Ryutin Affair"
 SOV_Aftermath_of_the_Ryutin_Affair_desc:0 "While chairman Stalin has been the leader of the Union for quite a few years now, there are still forces inside the party which oppose Stalin and his authoritarian way to achieving communism. While these forces mostly operate in secret groups inside the party recently a group under the leadership of Martemyan Ryutin and Nikolai Bukharin has openly positioned itself against Stalin by formulating a pamphlet called “Appeal to All Members of the All-Union Communist Party“ and a 200-page document “Stalin and the Crisis of the Proletarian Dictatorship“, which both fiercely criticized Stalin, referring to him as “gravedigger of the Revolution“, and his policies of rapid industrialization and forced collectivization.\n\nDespite the fact that it is unlikely that the Ryutin group will assume power anytime soon, the “Ryutin affair“ has shown and opened up deep wounds inside the CPSU, which will have to be tended to in order to save the revolution."

 SOV_Final_Phase_of_the_Decossackization:0 "Final Phase of the Decossackization"
 SOV_Final_Phase_of_the_Decossackization_desc:0 "Considered by many a nomadic, militaristic, and reactionary people, the cossacks present a challenge on our path to socialism. The Cossacks have long upheld the old order, repressing the peasants in the days of the Tsardom and fighting alongside Denikin's White Army in the Civil War. Since 1919 we have made several concerted efforts to eliminate the Cossacks as a class and as a culture. Agricultural collectivization has stripped the wealthiest cossacks of their lands, and cossacks from the Don to Irkutsk found guilty of counterrevolutionary activities in the thousands. Those once-mighty Cossacks, the right arm of the Tsar, are rapidly losing their identity, and the idea of a distinct cossack culture is fast becoming a distant memory."

 SOV_Deficient_Economy:0 "Deficient Economy"
 SOV_Deficient_Economy_desc:0 "While the first five year plans have been largely successful in transforming the Soviet Union from a primitive agrarian nation to a modern, industrial world global power, which is perfectly able to stand up to the economies of the western reactionaries in both size and production output, there are still a variety of inefficiencies preventing the Soviet Union from becoming the perfect example of an effective socialist economy.\n\nBut despite the progress reported and achieved by the Politburo, it is undeniable that exactly this rapid expansion has created a variety of problems, that have put a lid on the general efficiency of our economy through both uncoordinated planning and lackluster modernization efforts, while both bureaucratic obstacles and red tape have been growing rapidly since the start of the five-year plans. While these problems are definitely not overly dramatic and unsolvable, it will still need a large amount of work and optimization to fix these issues and finally make the Soviet economy a force to be reckoned with."
