 DH_WELCOME_TITLE: "Welcome to DARKEST HOUR"
 DH_WELCOME_DESC: "Thank you for playing the §RDARKEST HOUR§! mod. You are currently playing version §Y0.4.0§! of the mod. This version is a §Ypre-alpha§! version and will display the mod in a mostly unfinished state as such keep in mind that what you see will most likely changed or be fixed in the final product. Most of the world nations' focus trees are unimplemented; the focus trees and events that have been implemented are mostly functional however chances to encounter bugs, events not working, missing or poorly implemented localization, weird geopolitical situations and especially crashes are very high so do not expect  everything to go smoothly. The DARKEST HOUR team suggests that you wait for major updates before trying a preview version instead of using the 'in the works' version. This said we hope you enjoy the little preview of what is to come. For more information on upcoming content and the ability to ask and talk with the developers in a direct manner join us on our discord."

 # Mechanics:
 STARTING_SCREEN_TAB_MONEY: "Money"
 STARTING_SCREEN_TAB_MONEY_TEXT: "Aside from the new mechanics underway, we have created a rather special mechanic, one that can be utilized for any nation, regardless of its significance - Money System. Unlike most mods, who invest time and effort into the intricacies of economics, we have merely simplified it, in a way that is both equally important for gameplay yet easy to learn for both the player and the modder. \n\n§YHow does it work/How do you gain money?§!\n\nMoney is primarily gained from consumer goods factories and unused civilian factories. This emphasizes the importance of civilian factories, as they are only used as a way to build military factories, infrastructures, and trading with other nations. You can also earn money through taking out loans, although you have to remember to repay them, or it will take a hit on the economy, a BIG HIT.\n\n§YWhat can money be used for? How can we spend it?§!\n\nMoney is primarily spent for military factories - by assigning a factory to producing X, it will cost money. You can also spend the money for other things such as in events, decisions, or focuses. \n\n§YAre there any risks?§!\n\nInflation. Like any economies, inflation is vital for economic stability and harmony. Too much inflation, and you are diving into Venezuela or Weimar Republic style economies. It is important to manage inflation as much as possible, or it can seriously have consequences to the gameplay. Some of the main factors of inflation is by issuing new currency, or through loans. You can reduce inflation through "Deflationary Measures", but it is best to keep your economy in check or else...\n\n§YBankruptcy! Or "Everything is Fine"§!\n\nThis is the thing that you must truly avoid, or else your entire game has gone into a wreckfest. You will know if bankruptcy will happen because a countdown will start and all your money reserves are depleted. Gaining funds is of your major concern, or else the economy is in a death spiral."
