 DH_France_Turkey.1.d:0 "The leaders of the nation of Turkey have aproached us. They propose that the province of Hatay, in the northern-most point of Syria should have a referendum about staying in our great Syrian colony or becoming a state in their Republic. It was inhabited by ethnic Turks who left after the succesful war of independence. Altough many left for a better life, some people still remain, having lived here for generations. This does make it a good target for their leaders, it hasn't got any strategic value and it may convince them to join the War."

 DH_FRA_SFIO_Election.1.t:0 "XXXth Congress of SFIO at Paris"
 DH_FRA_SFIO_Election.1.d:0 "The building was packed. Party members moved across the crowd, currying political favour with every person, enacting schemes, some of them merely coming across friends and avidly discussing what was about to occur. The Neo-Socialists had led the SFIO for quite some time, and two of their members were set on becoming the leader of the party.\nLeon Blum watched the members across the massive room in which they had congregated in. There was not a moment that would go by where he wouldn’t notice someone eyeing him, as though keeping an eye on him for any show of weakness. If he wasn’t so used to it by now, it’d be nerve-wracking. He’d look back upon some of the less experienced members, matching their glare and making them jump out of their skin as though they’d just seen a ghost, making them look away. It gave him quite a laugh - something he needed right now.\nPierre Renaudel sat across from Blum, giving generic responses to some correspondents and lobbyists. Such was the life of a man who had to bear the burden of being labelled a traitor to the revolution; perhaps more so than Blum - for it was Renaudel that brought the SFIO into the Sacred Front unified governmental party in 1914 for the Great War, giving the French Government the political backing it needed to fight the war in full capacity. Many blame him; say it is his fault the revolution has not come to France yet. And what hypocrites they are, Pierre thinks. Such successes we have written in the name of the working class… and after today, more shall be written with his hand on the pen. Right? His own doubts plagued him as the assembly finally drew to a silence.\n“My fellow gentlemen, we are gathered here at the Thirtieth Congress of the SFIO - and the time has come once again for the people’s representative to be chosen. He will carry the burning flame of French revolutionary spirit with him as he goes onwards - and may it give him strength in his duties.” He looked down at the envelope passed to him by a final adjudicator.\n“The elected torchbearer of the French people is…”"

 DH_France.2.d:0 "It's the 1936 French legislative elections, one that is sure to be remembered. The current state of France, both social and economically has polarized politics. Socialists and the PCF wish to safeguard workers rights, paving a way for a revolution. The far-right leagues remain a powerful opposition despite attempts at keeping them down.

 DH_France.3.t:0 "General Strike"
 DH_France.3.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The victory of the Popular Front in the 1936 elections has provoked a massive strike. Workers have stopped working in practically every factory, efficiency and production have been slashed in half, and some laborers have taken it upon themselves to take their workplaces hostage. They are certain they will get what they want from the Popular Front, who was elected by them and ran on a platform of expanded rights for workers. Although we are being exploited, they are right. We must reach an agreement, and quickly. Every possible concession must be made to get our economy back on its feet, because if these strikes continue, it may remain crippled for years. The world is leaning once more towards war; we cannot afford to waste time and production."

 DH_France.4.t:0 "General Strike"
 DH_France.4.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]With the Republican Coalition's government well stablished for the time being, numerous union leaders, as well s the PCF leadership, have called for a massive strike across metropolitan France. They demand that "The rights of the French workforce are upheld by the state, and that no compromisse be made with the 'bourgeois coalition.'" Production has been halved and the already unstable republic wavers yet again. The Prime Minister has yet to release any official statements."

 DH_France.5.d:0 "The Anti-Republican general strike has reached its peak! The disease has spread across all of france, as more and more workers have joined their cause, those who don't are blocked from entering the factories by the legions of strikers that occupy them. France has stopped working, production-wise, our cabinet has entered complete chaos and the calls for action by the middle and upper classes have become impossible to ignore. Something must be done, immediately!"
 DH_France.5.A:0 "They will never have enough, will they?"

 DH_France.6.t:0 "More Strikes!"
 DH_France.6.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The general strike has expanded! Following the example of their cohorts, more and more workers across France have laid down their tools to protest their conditions and demand expanded rights. Before, production levels were brought low, but we were still  functioning. However, with this expansion, our entire economy has stagnated. This means our construction projects have halted, our factories can no longer produce, and no more guns are being made. We've got to reach an agreement no matter the cost. French industry won't survive much longer on the global market without it."
 DH_France.6.A:0 "Damn Strikes! Why can't they just be happy with what they have?"

 DH_France.7.t:0 "Matignon Compromise is signed!"
 DH_France.7.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The Anti-Republican strike has come to an end. The damage to our economy has yet to be accounted for, and the French citzen's views on the state has been somewhat tarnished, nevertheless, through careful coordination between our cabinet, factory owners and union leaders, we have managed to bring the country back from the verge of revolution. Both sides had to give up some of their demands, and it's unlikely they will remember us fondly for it, but an accord has been made, and things can go back to the way they were."

 DH_France.8.t:0 "Matignon Agreements signed!"
 DH_France.8.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The massive general strike that destroyed our economy is over. We have signed an agreement with the unions and the workers they represent to introduce a plethora of legislation aiming to augment the rights of workers. Among these concessions were the legal right to strike, the removal of all obstacles to union organization, and a blanket 7-12 percent wage increase for all workers. Although this agreement has fulfilled the demands of the strikers and will end the strikes, it has brought much criticism from the right, who insist that the government should have been much harsher in dealing with the strike and crushed those who refused to work. We have done what we promised in our campaign run, but the rightists may have a point; inflation is skyrocketing and we may have made the economy worse as it struggles to adapt to these sudden changes."

 DH_France.9.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]“One must know how to finish a strike, at the moment that the main points have been obtained.”\n Maurice Thorez, the leader of the Communist Party, has called for an end to the strikes that we have had such problems in dealing with. Slowly, across the country, men and women return to work, having obtained what they wanted. The Matignon Agreements have given them many new rights, and, soon, our economy will get back on its feet. However, our problems are not over. Factories are reporting struggles in adapting to the changes, workers still doubt our ability to restrain factory bosses, and the Popular Front is fracturing. Our problems have only begun."

 DH_France.10.t:0 "French Popular Party founded"
 DH_France.10.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Jacques Doriot, a once-avid communist who was expelled from his own party after advocating the formation of a Popular Front with the less-radical Socialist Party, has struck back at his party. After shifting towards a more "national" socialist viewpoint, Doriot decided to establish a new party whose agenda is more in line with that of Nazi Germany. The new Parti Populaire Francais may be easily confused with the Popular Front, but the two could not be more different. The new party calls Saint-Denis its home and, after the banning of fascist groups, extremists such as the Action Francaise and Croix de Feu are flocking to its banner. This does not bode well for France. We cannot have radicals tearing apart our internal stability as we faces threats abroad."

 DH_France.11.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Jacques Bainville, a prominent monarchist and avid hater of the German Reich, has passed away. His writings as a historian and journalist reveal a man disgusted with the direction of France in the past centuries, and he recruited many angry young souls to join him in the militant, fascist Action Francaise. However, he is most known for his writings on the Treaty of Versailles. He attacked the document that brought us peace, labeling it as “too harsh in its mild features, too mild in its harsh features,” believing that the treaty would provoke the German people to seek revenge while not stopping them from taking it. His burial shall take place in two days, but we have learned that he was denied the last rites by Cardinal Jean Verdier since the Pope condemned the Action Francais. Many in our government are glad to see the man gone, but his death may stir up trouble with the far right…"

 DH_France.12.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Léon Blum, the head of the Socialist Party, has been brutally attacked! As the moderate leftist departed the National Assembly, having his taxicab cross the funeral procession of Jacques Bainville, he was set upon by far-right militants known as the King’s Camelot and cut around the head. They were inspired by the rightist journalist Charles Maurras, who called for “the knife” to be used against politicians who supported the recent League of Nations sanctions against Italy earlier in the day. While active and devoted, the youth organization is looked down upon by other fascist groups for its violent tactics and its tendency to become involved in street brawls with leftist organizations and competitors among the right. This event will hopefully direct public opinion away from the right, but in the meantime, the president has declared its dissolution, along with its parent organization, the Action Francais. However, this may rile up both the left and the right..."

The brave British Expeditionary Force commanded by the famed General Lord Gort have crossed the English Channel yesterday and have arrived in France to help their soldiers fight the monstrous German war machine. They will travel around the country to arrive at the border, where they are supposed to stop another attack on the Benelux from the Jerry's. We hope that this will not develop in another 4 years of trench warfare and that we will stop this horrible ideology, making sure that Europe will not fall to it.  We will kick the Nazi bastards up the rear end, tally ho!"

 DH_France.14.d:0 "It is just as we expected. Leon Blum's beating has enraged the left, who are protesting our feeble crackdown on the far-right. However, much we might want to, harsh retaliation would only make the situation worse by giving the right a reason to, potentially, revolt. The last thing we need is a civil war, so we need to focus our efforts on calming both sides without choosing one, even if our policies are socialist. Let's take shelter and hope this storm passes and doesn't rip the roof off of French democracy, leaving it open to the elements."

 DH_France.15.d:0 "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]It is not the first time that the infamous poet and writer, Charles-Marie-Photius Maurras, has been put in jail for his off-handed comments and threats to French politicians. More than a decade ago, during the Cartel des Gauches' advances against the right-wing leagues, Maurras called for the assassination of Abraham Schrameck, at the time interior minister, leaving him a whole year behind bars. And yet again, as the Popular Front's programme continues, his threats against Léon Blum, it's figurehead, have earned him another eight months in jail. Charles Maurras' movement moves on, still, as the printing of the Action Française, and its movement, seems unfazed."

Movements and protests which call for an immediate independence of the country have now started a sixty-day-strike, guided by their nationalist leaders, which is having devastating effects on the economy and on our national stability. in order to avoid further and worse consequences, an immediate encounter between our and their leaders has been made.\n\nThis morning, in Paris, our president and a Syrian delegation signed the Viénot Accords, where we both agreed for a gradual independence of Syria in exchange for some economic reliefs, French military presence in the country and aid in case of war.\n\nKneeing to their requests might not be positive for our image, but in these difficult times, we need to preserve our stability."

 DH_France.17.d:0 "Reorganized in 1933, The Étoile Nord-Africaine independece movement still had ties to the PCF last decade, and although its current outfit is set on achieve Algeria's freedom through peaceful means, the risks of a revolution being sparked on our most valuable colonial holding, at the same time europe experiences a volatile period, are too great to be ignored.

This great event brings together the greatest nations in the world, inviting them to showcase the best work of the artists they call their own. But, as all things these days, the exhibition was hijacked by competing nations. The Germans designed their pavilion to stand as a sort of "bulwark" against the Soviets, with the eagles and swastikas familiar to their regime and a large statue, depicting two naked men joining hands, staring defiantly at the Soviet pavilion across the pond. This one had atop its roof the famous statue, "Worker and Kolkhoz Woman" depicting a man and a woman carrying, respectively, a hammer and a sickle, thrusting forward. Italy, being Italian, attempted to bring forth the image of a benevolent dictatorship, with murals depicting Italian technology and the success of Corporatism. The British pavilion, by far, was the least impressive, being a simple white box, containing words that we French use that come from the English language. The event was a success, bringing thousands of spectators, but one wonders whether the competitiveness on display is a sign of times to come..."

Effectively, the government has collapsed and now all that remains is the Radical Party, led by Edouard Daladier. The new Liberal governmnent has a legacy of failures to leave behind and great changes in Europe's horizon to endure.

The internal strife between Socialists, the PCF and the Radicals has reached a tipping point within the Popular Front government, the Socialists ineptitude has forced the Radicals within the coalition into expelling them, while the PCF, in their blind support for the Czech state, have turned against the Front's appeasement policy.

Just as our ancestors raided that castle to show the King that they would not bow, so we must struggle against those who wish to usurp our democracy. This becomes more and more important in recent days, with the rise of extremist ideologies and threats to French sovereignty. The French tricolor continues to wave in the roughest of weather. So we must uphold our ways. But this day is not one for worry. It is one for celebration of our past, the present, and whatever lies in the future.

 DH_France.26.d:0 "With communism banned in France, and the PCF recognized as illegal, it seems that the party's Secretary General Maurice Thorez, rather than accepting the draft decided to flee into the Soviet Union. While this might be considered a hard blow against the far-left in France, partisanship is unlikely to wean, and even though many have considered armed resistence despite the outcome of the upcoming conflict, there are many that continue to claim that a a non-revolutionary power-struggle should remain the focus of the PCF remnants. Thorez himself claimed he'll continue to write for the the party's newspaper, the "Humanité Clandestine," and his sway over the French left is likely to remain strong."

Every day, fascist groups inspire more and more of those who might have been sympathetic to our cause to riot against our government as communist organizations gain power, supported from afar by Moscow. Our cherished democracy is feeble, weakened by constant struggle. Many advocate an abandonment of our socialist goals to unify the country as war looms, but we have chosen to instead push harder than ever to bring France into a new age of prosperity. We will increase and widen our economic programs. But the extent of which to do this is hotly debated among the Popular Front. The most moderate in our ranks propose a small reform, to avoid taxing our resources. Another solution is a larger wave of reforms, which will increase our expenditure, but convince many that our administration is doing as promised. The radicals dismiss these solutions, and instead advocate a push for the largest reorganization possible, which will tax our resources greatly and risks angering the right but will ensure an economic benefit. Parliament is meeting to choose our path."

However, our once glorious empire has fallen into disrepair. Our portion of Africa has no industrial base, guerilla separatists harass our forces in Asia, and the dockyards in French Polynesia, among others, are small and useless. This must change.

Now, what actions will be carried out against the strikers is on the Prime Minister's hands, and the results of such actions are only his to bear.

Soon enough, guards of the Minicipal Police, alongside mounted Gendarmerie started to disperse the crowd by force, and the order was repeated throughout the country. In total, at least 13 wounded have been reported, but luckily no deaths occured.

After heated discussion with the privates ordered there, a series of shovings between them and the strikers resulted in a, allegedly, misfire that sparked the whole building on fire. Five men perished on the flames. As the news reached the leaders of the CGT-SR and the PCF, both have agreed to, rather than calling out the strikes altoghter, strenghten the resolve of the protests, and have urged all to return to the factories, and under no circustance allow the general strikes to die down. Violence has erupted between the Police, Armed Forces and Strikers, PCF members and deserters all across Metropolitan France, and uncofirmed news about more deaths float around the press.

Interestingly enough, French newspapers discovered that, soon after they were freed, none else than Maurice Thorez himself asked for the other leaders from the now dissoluted left-leaning leagues, as well as union leaders of the CGT, to convene into a yet unknown location.

 DH_France.36.d:0 "A gunshot that might forever change France's destiny echoed across Paris today, when, after an incursion against a local garrison post in the outskirts of town, what could only be described as a human wave managed to take over and barricade the building. When the police was dispached to the outpost, a single shot erupted into a bloody skirmish between PCF members, aided by partisans from the CGT and other minor far-left parties, and the municipal guard. Those who returned to town described none other than Maurice Thorez himself was leading the crowd, and without warning dozens of accounts started to come from across metropolitan France, describing workers, many yelding weapons of foreign-design, taking over buildings, police stations and army outposts, setting fire to barracks and stealing provisions. Later, Maurice Thorez gathered an even bigger crowd, yet to be counted, and declared that ""the era of white terrorism must be brought down, with or without peace"" before declaring the French Socialist Republic. Europe watches in fear."

But someone needed to the job that no one wanted to do and spreading the truth that no one wanted to admit. Almost got blown to pieces in Verdun, and for what? For the Communists to waste his hard-working money to give it to degenerate low-lives and their corrupt friends? Fortunately, at least he had a loyal companion keeping his sanity: the wooden cross on the wall as a reminder to fulfill his duties as a Christian. As he started to take a sip out of his morning coffee, Jacques burst through the door cursing. “What is it now, Jacques? Another incident with the Jews?” the party bureaucrat asked, drinking from his coffee mug. Albert was already used to the bad temper of his partner, but something seemed different about his usual tantrums today.\n“Remember that Communist scumbag that got killed by the police? Guess who was protecting him?” exclaimed Jacques as he angrily threw a newspaper on the desk. Reading the newspaper cover, Albert started to squeeze the pages angrily: "TIES OF STAVISKY WITH THE GOVERNMENT REVEALED. HIGH-RANKING POLITICIANS INVOLVED IN COUNTERFEIT SCANDAL." Departing from his usual calm and calculating demeanor, he could barely contain his fury. “This is outrageous! Our government is a nest of corrupt degenerate rats!” he screamed. Lighting a cigarette, the hot-blooded young fascist couldn’t hide that he enjoyed seeing the old man losing his cool for once. “Do you think I just came here to deliver the newspaper? This shit is already spreading everywhere! The francists are even more pissed off than us!” After regaining composure, Albert started to move his finger through the phone dial. This occasion required all the French patriots to stand up against the corrupt government, even the heretics of Action Française. “Lucien? It’s me, Albert. Look, I don’t care anymore about whatever Pagan bullshit you believe. More important things are happening right now.”"

Originally, the concept of a National Lottery was introduced through the Royal Lottery of France by the old Bourbon monarchy. We can't deny the usefulness of some ideas of the Ancient Regime, even if our distaste for the monarchic form of government should be pretty obvious at this point. Charity raffles and other forms of clandestine lotteries are already pretty common, but hopefully this one will bring money to the state coffers."

Thanks to his clerk that bought the winner ticket with the number 18414, the hairdresser won the considerable sum of five million francs. However, Bonhoure is already receiving death threats from several people mad at him from winning the price, so we'll recommend the following winners to be more discreet about it from now on."

Since the surplus still influences the market, prices are continuing to decline, threatening to ruin many agricultural cooperatives. To help the farmers affected by the price declines, the government has issued a law fixing wheat prices. The decree establishes that wheat cannot be sold below the price of 115 francs per quintal, regardless if stocked under contract or not. This fixed price will increase every month by the Ministry of Agriculture to finance storage and handling costs. These measures however are temporary, and the market will return to normal once we solve this problem."

 DH_FRA_Milices_Fascistes.1.d:0 "The French political drama continues as a new party enters stage right. Inspired by the fascism of Benito Mussolini, war hero Marcel Bucard's Mouvement Franciste upholds nationalist, authoritarian, and antisemitic thought, hoping to transform France into a fascist dictatorship in the mold of Italy.\nBucard has bounced around the far-right since 1918, first as a member of the royalist Action française and later joining Georges Valois' Faisceau, Solidarité francais, and Croix-de-Feu. Seemingly unsatisfied with these groups, Bucard decided to strike out on his own; Mouvement Franciste is arguably more radical than any preceding groups.\nWhile still relatively small, with around 10,000 members, the movement edits its own newspaper, Le Francisme, and operates a paramilitary known as the Blueshirts. MF's disproportionate level of activity compared to its size has many wondering how the movement funds itself, with some directing their gaze across the Alps to Rome. While most of France views the movement with indifference at best, Bucard's words under the Arc de Triomphe resonate with a not-insignificant fraction of the population."

Many doubt his ability to control the more radical part of his coalition, but he has established firm control over his government."

 FRA_Armee_de_Terre:0 "Armée de Terre"
 FRA_Armee_de_Terre_desc:0 "Once, French armies struck fear into the hearts of our enemies. Once, we were the most powerful military force in the world. That is no longer. Our doctrines are outdated, our soldiers are badly equipped, and we hide behind a wall of cement, hoping for peace. The world is changing, and we must change with it, or risk falling behind. To our east, the Germans remilitarise, hungry for war, and to the north, the English, our erstwhile allies, attempt to appease the Prussian Menace. Next time war comes, it must not be like the War of 1870. We must modernize the very boots on the ground."

 FRA_Armee_de_lAir:0 "Armée De L'air"
 FRA_Armee_de_lAir_desc:0 "In the first days of flight, France was at the forefront of aviation technology. The best and the brightest in this field called our country home. La Patrie even gave birth to the first fighter pilot ever. However, after the devastation of the Great War, less and less industry was allocated to making new planes. We need to nationalize the aircraft industry and build the once-proud Armée de l’Air back to its glory. The Germans have simply ignored the restrictions on their aircraft, building new, better planes that outmatch our antiquated ones. This cannot be allowed. After these reforms have finished, the enemy will fear the sound of French aircraft."

 FRA_Marine_National:0 "Marine National"
 FRA_Marine_National_desc:0 "Many think that British naval supremacy is a fact of life. They believe that no one ever challenged the Royal Navy and succeeded. They are wrong. There was once a time when French ships ruled the waves, unopposed. Unfortunately, that time is long gone. But it does not need to be gone forever. we need to build up our fleet and modernize its doctrines so that The French Navy will once again be feared. The French Tricolor will sail the seas, and every sailor will once more be proud to serve in the Marine Nationale. But before we can even dream of returning to such glory we have work to do. It's time to rearm the Navy."

 FRA_Empire_Coloniale_Francais:0 "Empire Colonial Français"
 FRA_Empire_Coloniale_Francais_desc:0 "French power stretches across the globe. We triumphed in the Race for Africa, and secure the colonies of the Germans after we defeated them in the Great War. We control Indochina, a rich source of tea, rice, coffee, pepper, coal, zinc and tin, and various islands that we can use to project naval power. However, our once glorious empire has fallen into disrepair. Our portion of Africa has no industrial base, guerilla separatists harass our forces in Asia, and the dockyards in French Polynesia, among others, are small and useless. This must change. War is brewing in Europe, and we must have the ability to draw upon the power of our colonies should the French homeland ever fall into enemy hands. Soon, the French Colonial Empire will be a force to reckon with on its own."

 FRA_Blums_Labour_Reforms:0 "Léon Blum's Labour Reforms"
 FRA_Blums_Labour_Reforms_desc:0 "The election of Blum’s government has brought a wave of strikes. Nearly 2 million workers have abandoned their posts, leaving our economy crippled. The strikes were unorganized and spontaneous, but many prominent members of the business community have met with Blum to help negotiate with the strikers. Blum has decided to institute a series of labor reforms, among which give workers the right to strike and created the 40-hour work week, then credit the labor unions for the new, so-called Matignon Accords. We have a majority in the Senate, so we should not wait to call a vote. Doubters of this new policy say that, however honorable its intentions, it may damage our economy even worse…"

 FRA_Price_Control_and_Public_Works:0 "Price Control and Public Works"
 FRA_Price_Control_and_Public_Works_desc:0 "Our reforms have caused a huge increase in inflation. We are up 46%, and our opponents are using this as an excuse to attack our policies. We should institute large programs of price control to remedy this before our popular support evaporates. First off, we should create an Office du Blé to market agricultural products at fair prices for farmers, then we should shift the higher tax burden off the consumers and onto the producers. An unnecessary, but the popular program has been started: a massive public works project to improve the quality of life in our industrial centers and cities. This should ensure continuing support for our administration."

 FRA_Nationalise_Arms_Industry:0 "Nationalize Arms Industry"
 FRA_Nationalise_Arms_Industry_desc:0 "Our enemies are rearming even quicker than we expected. Each day, thousands of their men are equipped and sent to prepare for war while our economy flounders. Our sudden imposition of the 40-hour workweek, among other things, has left every industry in France struggling to adapt, tanking their efficiency. Although our opponents among the right may criticise this move as “communist,” the economy is in dire need of government intervention. We need to step in to fuel rearmament as quickly as possible, and only one solution presents itself; the complete nationalization of the arms industry. We will commandeer the production of weapons to ensure that when the storm comes, France’s young soldiers will be well equipped to weather it."

 FRA_Issue_Industrial_Grants:0 "Issue Industrial Grants"
 FRA_Issue_Industrial_Grants_desc:0 "Since the end of the war and the economic crash that followed it, France could, or rather needs, to reinvigorate its most basic industries. By reaching private investors and agreeing to subsidize large-scale development plans, we could, with some work, quickstart some parts of the economy in no time. These factories could serve as the backbone of our civilian industry in the following years."

 FRA_Dissolve_Fascist_Leagues:0 "Dissolve Fascist Leagues"
 FRA_Dissolve_Fascist_Leagues_desc:0 "In the last years, far-right movements in France have been on the rise. Blinded by foolish dreams of a greater and more powerful France, our citizens are flocking to these extremist leagues. They join their riotous manifestations and boycott public services in some kind of flawed form of protest. Several attempts of appeasing these groups have been made, but not a single one has brought substantial results. In the past few days, the situation has worsened: whispers of these movements allying with foreign powers have reached our ears, threatening our national security. Before the problem gets even bigger and external forces to get involved, a complete and total ban of these far-right movements must be put in place. Our political stability will suffer, but a greater good is at play."

 FRA_Victory_of_the_Republican_Coalition:0 "Victoire de la Coalition Républicaine"
 FRA_Victory_of_the_Republican_Coalition_desc:0 "The ways of the past triumph again. The Republican Coalition, battered by internal power struggles between Louis Marin and Pierre-Etienne Flandin, managed to secure the popular vote, and with it, a continuation of their power. They also obtained a slight majority in the Senate, so the defeated leftists cannot enforce their will out of office. But Marin and Flandin cannot govern together, and nor will they accept compromises. Their long rivalry is coming to head. Marin, a democratic, but a liberal nonetheless, despises the radical rightist Flandin’s policies. Whichever one secures victory must lead us through dangerous times, and keep our country from falling back into the Absolutist ways of the past."

 FRA_Marins_Liberal_Conservative_Diet:0 "Marin's Liberal Conservative Diet"
 FRA_Marins_Liberal_Conservative_Diet_desc:0 "It seems that, with the Republican victory, the liberal-democratic alternative, Louis Marin has been choosen to lead France as its prime minister. His centrist rhetoric and diplomatic standpoint might serve the country well in the years to come."

 FRA_Tax_Breaks_for_Small_Businesses:0 "Tax Breaks For Small Buisnesses"
 FRA_Tax_Breaks_for_Small_Businesses_desc:0 "France has always been the ideal home for new opportunities, attracting those eager to build a new business and make their mark on the world. As our economy is faltering, many of these small enterprises are finding it difficult to stay afloat, while larger ones survive easily. In order to ease this burden, a simple solution has been approved; a blanket tax break on smaller businesses, reducing their debt to the government in these hard times. As they no longer will be burdened by excessive taxes, we will see growth, as income once taxed will flow into expansion. This should aid the economy somewhat, and provide more jobs."

 FRA_Austerity_Measures:0 "Austerity Measures"
 FRA_Austerity_Measures_desc:0 "The French people must give up the comforts of wealth in the name of the state. Our economy has taken many hits, and only true austerity can allow it time to recover. Additionally, we can redirect what is usually spent on frivolities to industrial expansion in Paris proper, giving new opportunities for the workers laid off as our economy struggled. We can also create a fund for research into modern industry technologies, aiding the disenfranchised and lowering the required skill for factory work."

 FRA_Flandins_Radical_Government:0 "Flandin's Radical Government"
 FRA_Flandins_Radical_Government_desc:0 "Now that the dust has settled and the Republican Coalition has found itself leading France's government, former leader of the democratic Republican Alliance, Pierre-Étienne Flandin has once again been appointed as Prime Minister. A wildcard, Flandin's past work has warmed France's relations with Italy and even the Soviet Union, through the proposed Stresa Front and the Franco-Soviet pact, respectively."

 FRA_Crackdown_On_Strikers:0 "Keeping the Unions in Check"
 FRA_Crackdown_On_Strikers_desc:0 "As the past weeks have come to show, France cannot tolerate the whims and wishes of the rabble-rousing Unions, for everytime she founds itself weakened, on her darkest hour, they come into play, through violence and subterfuge, to kick her while she is down. If we are to have any chance on surviving on the years to come, these acts of treason against the Republic must, and shall, be treated as such."

 FRA_Ban_Far_Left_Organizations:0 "Ban Far-Left Organizations"
 FRA_Ban_Far_Left_Organizations_desc:0 "Although we pride ourselves on the merits of free speech and expression, difficult times are tearing us apart. We can no longer afford to allow far-left organizations to influence our citizens and stir them to rebellion against the government. Unfortunately, no other solution has presented itself but to ban these organizations completely. Although rooting out the members of the PCF, among others, may prove difficult and tax our resources somewhat, in the long run, our advisors say it will improve the overall stability of our proud nation."

 FRA_Country_Wide_Industrial_Development:0 "Country-Wide Industrial Development"
 FRA_Country_Wide_Industrial_Development_desc:0 "Our industry is lagging behind compared to that of our enemies, and, should war come to our lands, we will need to rely on a heavy industrial base to support us. We should use government funds and workers to construct industries in our largest cities, dealing them out to companies that we can trust. This development, although rushed and expensive, will help us in future projects."

 FRA_Rearmament_Effort:0 "Rearmament Effort"
 FRA_Rearmament_Effort_desc:0 "It is clear that Europe is, once again, heading towards war. Denying that fact is endangering the lives of millions of French men, women and children. Yes, our scars from the Great War have yet to heal, our economy is in shambles and our populace is deeply divided by it, and keep pretending that everything will be fine is no longer an option at this point. From here onwards, our government's priority is giving the army a chance at staving off France's enemies, we'll issue the order to build new factories, and demand that production begins forthwith."

 FRA_Corporative_Contracts:0 "Corporative Contracts"
 FRA_Corporative_Contracts_desc:0 "War is coming, and we're going to need a large, readily available industrial center to turn to the war effort. However, the government's resources are spent, and we simply cannot devote the funds needed into a large-scale construction project. Luckily, a few French corporations have proposed that we deal out the jobs to them, in return for assured government support. This should provide exactly what we need, while also freeing up funds that we can use elsewhere."

 FRA_Fearless_Nation:0 "Fearless Nation"
 FRA_Fearless_Nation_desc:0 "The French people must be ready for war. They must be ready to offer up their lives to the defense of our country, ready to abandon all to form a shield against France's enemies. Fearless men and women from across the country will fight those who threaten our sovereignty without longing for easier times. When they come, our foes will not find a nation of weak-willed, greedy individuals who care more about their possessions than the country's safety. We must rile up the people for war, and put bravery into the hearts of each one. War is coming. Our people must be ready."

 FRA_Girauds_Defensive_Approach:0 "Giraud's Defensive Approach"
 FRA_Girauds_Defensive_Approach_desc:0 "There is no need to risk the safety of the French nation pursuing wild dreams of new, offensive doctrines that will do little but get more Frenchmen killed. Henri Giraud, a Great War veteran who escaped from a German prison, advocated the strategy of building lines of fortification to stop the enemy in their tracks. Although this tactic may seem familiar to those who suffered in the trenches of the Great War, we have evolved and matured the doctrine in past years so that the enemy will not advance into France while our troops languish. But to defend properly, we must create additional fortifications along the Maginot Line and up to the coast. We may also need to consider the second line of fortifications along the Seine if the Maginot falls..."

 FRA_Lessons_of_the_Great_War:0 "Lessons de la Grande Guerre"
 FRA_Lessons_of_the_Great_War_desc:0 "More than a million of our finest men lost their lives in the trenches of the Great War, driving back the Germans as they charged at our lines. Now, as the world edges ever closer to the brink of total war, we must review the lessons we exchanged for blood to be ready to face the next threat. Trench warfare will stop our enemies in their tracks. Long, coordinated assaults will bring them to their knees. Just as in the Great War, these methods will ensure that the French people remain free from foreign oppression. We must refine and improve this trusted doctrine."

 FRA_Citoyen_Soldat:0 "Citoyen-Soldat"
 FRA_Citoyen_Soldat_desc:0 "It is essential that every citizen of France, be he young, old, rich or poor, which can take up a rifle, must be prepared to defend his country, to march forth against her enemies in the face of certain death. It is his duty to defend the Republic, as it was his father's during the Great War, and as it shall be for his sons. Legions shall be recruited into the army, and each and every family, from Calais to Nice and Paris to Brittany, shall have a man enlisted. Only through the strength in numbers, can victory be assured."

 FRA_Grande_Batterie:0 "Grande Batterie"
 FRA_Grande_Batterie_desc:0 "Control of the artillery was the decisive tactic, which during the Great War, not only claimed our best, but also allowed us to achieve victory. The power of pounding an enemy, kilometers away from the frontlines, both a practical and psychological tool, proved the importance of Big Guns, and recent developments can make its applications to not only bombard, but also be able penetrate even toughest tanks. These new models can make the difference between absolute victory and an enemy breakthrough."

 FRA_Levee_en_Masse:0 "Levée en Masse"
 FRA_Levee_en_Masse_desc:0 "No matter how many we rally under the Tricolore, they will perish needlessly if they are not armed suffieciently. We must call upon every common worker of France to double his effort at the factory, to spend day and night toiling to produce weapons, so that, when war comes, the French soldier shall find arms waiting for him, and not the other way around. We must also be ready to harness the patriot worker's spirit during war, to call them to replenish our reserves and refill our stocks, so that France may never bear the weight of foreign oppression as it has not since the Franco-Prussian War."

 FRA_Fortify_the_Maginot:0 "Fortify the Maginot"
 FRA_Fortify_the_Maginot_desc:0 "We are almost completly done with the construction of the Maginot Line, but the military is split on their priorities. The Armée de l'Air claim the safety of our skies should be our main concern, as our enemies continue to refine their planes and produce incredible numbers of flying machines. They will most likely dominate the skies without any considerable effort if we do not make additional preparations for their assault, so the Armee de l'Air recommends building AA emplacements. However, the Armée de Terre claim enemy ground forces should be our primary concern. Should the enemy be able to break through the Maginot Line, our proudest achievment, then the war will take a dark turn, especially with the drop in morale that is sure to result. They believe we should devote our remaining funds to finishing the Line's fortifications and improving them."

 FRA_Grande_Armee:0 "La Nouvelle Grande Armée"
 FRA_Grande_Armee_desc:0 "Through much toil and expenditure, the Grande Armee is once more a force to be reckoned with. Its doctrines have been modernized and standardized, new recruits eagerly answer the call to arms, talented officers directly our soldiers well, and modern equipment enhances its combat abilities. We can be proud of a stable, efficient defense force that can defend our soil from those who wish to strip our sovereignity away."

 FRA_Tactiques_des_Tirailleurs:0 "Tactiques des Tirailleurs"
 FRA_Tactiques_des_Tirailleurs_desc:0 "The Tirailleur's, or light infantry's, methods for using quick movement, as well infiltration tactics to scout, ambush or simply surround the enemy have been well-documented since the Nepoleonic-era. By modernizing, expanding and giving enough support, we can adapt such conecpts to better suit the modern battlefields of Europe and our colonies."

 FRA_Tactiques_de_la_Legion:0 "Tactiques de la Legion"
 FRA_Tactiques_de_la_Legion_desc:0 ""Divide and Conquer" is more than a simple axiom taught to officers during their classes, its a rule of war. If one is outnumbered, but can identify a weaker concentration of enemies, isolated in a specific location, and manages to concentrate his firepower on it victory is assured. All and all, despite all the changes warfare has suffered, some things simply don't change."

 FRA_Vague_Humaine:0 "Vague Humaine"
 FRA_Vague_Humaine_desc:0 "Numbers, and nothing else, are the key that opens the door to success on the battlefield. If France, and its army are big enough to stretch the enemies forces thin, the weaker and slower they become, and thus a spearhead, or any concentration of force can be easily avoided, lest the invader wishes to found himself surrounded."

 FRA_DeGaulles_Offensive_Approach:0 "De Gaulle's Offensive Approach"
 FRA_DeGaulles_Offensive_Approach_desc:0 "Above all, we cannot sit sur nos fesses and wait for the enemy to come and attack us. Sitting in a cozy bunker may seem appealing when soldiers charge at you and wait to be gunned down, but warfare is rapidly changing. New doctrines theorize lightning battles and rapid maneuvers that encircle enemy fortifications, cutting off their supply lines and starving them to death without setting a foot near their cement fortifications. This nightmare cannot happen in France. We must dismiss such fanciful hopes for defense like the Maginot Line, and focus fully on taking the fight to our enemies before they can do the same to us. Charles de Gaulle, a friend of Philippe Petain, a Dreyfusard, and a proponent of armored warfare has come into command of our military. He will serve well to further this unconventional approach to warfare."

 FRA_Colonial_Garrison:0 "Colonial Garisson"
 FRA_Colonial_Garrison_desc:0 "A worldwide empire like ours is not, by any means, easy to control. Manifestations, protests and insurrections could fire up in any moment and rapidly escalate to violent national revolts against our rule. In order to avoid this, some generals have proposed to provide our most precious colonies with new Garrison Regiments which will constantly maintain local stability. Also, having new troops dislocated around our empire could give us tactical advantages during wartime."

 FRA_Legion_Etrangere:0 "Légion Etrangère"
 FRA_Legion_Etrangere_desc:0 "The branch of our Army known as The "Legion Entrangère," is open to all foreigners willing to fight for our country. In its long and glorious history, it has accepted in its ranks men from all over the world and participated to various missions and wars. Unfortunately, since the end of The Grear War, the numbers of volunteers in the Legion have dramatically decreased, leaving it almost useless for any task. By then publicising it and renewing by its old glory, we might be able to encourage foreigners to enlist in great numbers once again and serve loyally our great country, for every men is needed in these dark times."

However, we don't have the funds we need to start a program of motorization that would be effective in equipping our men with trucks.

Tanks, a weapon tested only in the last years of the Great War, have incredible potential to fill these roles. Not only can large, more heavily armored variants provide a bulwark against advancing forces, but smaller, lightweight models can race forwards and outmanuever the enemy. Of course, simply producing these machines is not enough.

This can be dangerous in combat situations, given that they are mutually dependent: infantry rely on tanks to cover them, artillery relies on infantry to protect them, and tanks rely on artillery to support their advance.

This combined with the recent economic crisis has led to an unprecedented amount of Frenchmen being pushed towards extremism. While the situation so far is still stable, with only an occasional strike or riot disturbing the peace.\nThe pressure inside France is increasing and it's almost a certainty that the Republic will not survive unless something is done to fix the problems plaguing France."

 FRA_Deep_Economic_Crisis_desc:0 "Like other countries around the world, France has been deeply affected by the Stock market crash in 1929 and the following depression. While France has so far not been as severely affected by the depression as other countries, the effects are still proving to be a great burden on our economy. Millions of young men have become unemployed, while businesses and factories are closing down, left and right, decreasing our production capabilities. Furthermore, our national debt has begun increasing steadily and will reach a critical mass unless the situation improves in due time. \nThe government so far tried to reduce the effects of the crisis by following a strict restrictive and austerity focused policy, which greatly angered the populace who is now steadily beginning to flock towards communist and fascist political parties, in the hopes of overturning the status quo. While the situation so far is still under control, the leaders of France still have a lot of work to do in order to save the economy and by extension the republic."

 FRA_Politicized_Staff_desc:0 "France has always been a polarized country in terms of politics ever since the revolution, the moderates, and the Jacobins, the Bonapartists and the republicans, the radicals and the conservatives, it's all part and parcel of the great system of democracy. But just as any state, democratic or not, the nation is driven by the institutions and apparatuses that it is comprised of but while in other countries these institutions tend to be dominated by a constricted social class we in France pride ourselves in being able to say that every institution has representation for all facets of society.\n\nHowever this, while sounding quite good the daily newspaper it is not so healthy for the administration of the state and especially the defense. Our officer corps and general staff are just as fragmented and polarized as the rest of our citizens, bickering over not only military doctrines and divisional organization but also over ministers and political philosophy. With the Dreyfus Affair still fresh in the mind of many, it seems that unless a serious crackdown on such political activism within the corps is enacted the infighting will continue to undermine the security of our very state."

Even if we managed to avoid the worst of the depression, the effects of the crisis still prove to be catastrophic for the economy. Millions of workers in endless rows looking for employment after countless factories and businesses closed their doors, affecting our production capabilities considerably. Our debt increases more and more, threatening to collapse the financial system.\nIn a time where the populace is starting to shift to the far-left and far-right parties, the French political establishment has decided that deep economic reform is the best course of action. The government will intervene in the crucial sectors of the industry and agriculture to safeguard the interests of workers and investors and create new institutions to regulate the market and collect money to protect the poorest levels of society. But the biggest challenge will be implementing budget cuts not only in unproductive areas of the state but also cutting the huge salaries of bureaucrats and politicians.
