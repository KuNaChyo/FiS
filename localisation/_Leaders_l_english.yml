 # Afghanistan
 Mohammed_Zahir_desc:0 "Mohammed Zahir Shah, King of Afghanistan rules Afghanistan, along with his uncle, Mohammed Hashim Khan and Shah Mahmud Khan. He has overseen a prosperous reign of internationalism and expansion of the economy. While new to the throne, he is popular among the people of Afghanistan."

 # Australia
 John_Curtin_desc:0 "A supporter of the workers. Advocate for the unions. MP in Parliament for Labour, and finally Prime Minister. John Curtin has the ability to say I was all of these over the span of his life. Rising to prominence through the Labor Party in the 1920s, and eventually taking the reigns after James Scullin stepped down, this Western Australian politician has a lot to live up to.\n\nDespite the shift of leaders, the Labor Party still struggled after the loss of experienced politicians such as Joseph Lyons and James Fenton. But this time was a learning experience for them. Under Curtin's firm, guiding hand of leadership they were united, strong, with one common goal: Rights for the working man and their family. Campaigning strongly for the common man, Curtin gained popularity, as did the Labor Party as a whole.\n\nThe Labor Party under him has fought tooth and nail with the United Australia Party, over the economy, tariffs, pensions, and trade. Curtin strongly advocates for rearmament, seeing the threat of the ever-growing empire of Japan. The UAP toes the line of the Conservatives in London, with some in the Labor Party quietly following along. Now that Curtin is in office, he will have to tackle the unwillingness of the Australian people to go to war and prepare them for the oncoming global conflict. \n\nAs the years go by, leaders come and go, as do political ideologies. However only a few Prime Ministers are recognised for their achievements and are thanked for them. No matter what happens in the years to come, John Curtin shall be one of those Prime Ministers."
 Ben_Chifley_desc:0 "Many politicians deal with compromises and promises. However, a strong leader deals in absolutes. He fights for what he believes in and doesn't give in to the other side until he has achieved victory. Many call this stubbornness. Others call it strong-willed. With Ben Chifley, it's safe to call it both.\n\nA man who served with the Labor Party since the 1920s, Chifley is a true loyalist to Labor's cause, and he has never swayed from the party. Serving briefly as a Defence Minister in the 1930s, he cemented himself in a position close to John Curtin and bravely followed him to victory in 1941. Serving through World War Two, he never let the stress of the conflict get to him. Unfortunately, Curtin never lived to see the end of the war, and Chifley took up his torch as Prime Minister.\n\nFighting for the soldiers to return as soon as possible, he is constantly in a battle with the newly formed Liberal Party's leader 'Pig Iron Bob', the man who sold Australia's iron to the Japanese. The conflict between them is almost as fierce as the one fought between Curtin and Lyons before the war. Nevertheless, Chifley shall continue to lead the country into the direction he sees fit, and the direction many Australians agree with.\n\nAs the Pacific War slowly ends, Chifley must quickly convert from wartime government to a peaceful Prime Ministership. How he carries himself in the peace after the greatest conflict in history will define his government. One certain thing is that the new peacetime political landscape shall be extremely different, for better or worse."

 # Brazil
 Getulio_Vargas_desc:0 "Getulio Vargas, President of the Republic of The United States of Brazil, leads Brazil in his sixth year as “president”. His dictatorship, the “Estado Novo”, or New State, seems to be on the track to rule Brazil for a long time. While Brazil remains within the United States sphere of influence, Vargas’ regime has taken a lot of inspiration from the populist regimes that arose in Europe after the Great War, and could very well see it’s nation dragged into the next one."

 # Britain
 Ramsay_MacDonald_desc:0 "If there was a man, a politician, to represent the socialists of the British Isles, James Ramsay Mcdonald would fit that role perfectly.\n\nBorn on October 12, 1866, in Lossiemouth, Scotland, the illegitimate son to poor Scottish parents, Mcdonald lived in the right place and the right time to become accepting of Marxist ideals. Joining the Social Democratic Federation, and later Bristol Socialist Society, at the ripe ol’ age of 19, would prove to be beneficial to his immediate and longterm political success in London. This success culminated in his joining of the Labour Representation Committee in 1900 and his later acquisition of the position of chairman of the party in 1911, then called the Labour Party. The British political scene would never be the same, however, when Macdonald was able to secure the position of Prime Minister in the election of 1923. From thenceforward, Macdonald hasn't left the political sphere.\n\nMacdonald was not able to do much in the 10 months he was Prime Minister, as Stanley Baldwin regained the position in November of 1924. However in that meantime, the support for the Labour Party grew, and Macdonald took back the Prime Ministership in 1931. It is uncertain whether Ramsey MacDonald will be able to keep his leadership, for the tories lurk ever closer to snatching it away."
 Stanley_Baldwin_desc:0 "A man born to wealthy beginnings will experience his fair share in life.\n\nLittle changes from this trope when on the subject of Stanley Baldwin. Born to a well-off background, Baldwin was a fitting image for a life of politics, but he did not see Parliament his whole life. He has his experience on the Industrial side of life, and, like any good politician, he had his fair share of army time, but never saw any conflict.\n\nSince becoming an MP was not enough of a goal for him in his relatively old age, Baldwin quickly rose through the ranks of both government and party. Tragedy in the Tories opened the window of opportunity for Baldwin, and he became Prime Minister in 1923 and 1924. His tenure would last to 1929, where the Labour party would win in the elections and force Baldwin into opposition. Unfortunately for his successor, Baldwin became Lord President of the Council and set his sights once more on the Prime Ministership.\n\nBaldwin achieved this goal, clawing his way back to the top, and now sees the crises developing all over the world. Worse are the domestic issues, primarily economic problems all over Britain and the rise of extremist factions on the Isle. Finally, the failing health of the King threatens a royal succession, but Baldwin has little time to worry about this.\n\nWith King George on his last legs, only time will tell how the accession of his son will alter Baldwin’s course."
 Winston_Churchill_desc:0 "War. It has once again gripped the world, and the United Kingdom was not prepared. This lack of preparation now has them in a precarious position, with much of Europe already in the hands of fascism.\n\nThis didn’t have to happen. The policy of appeasement was a mistake as it only showed weakness while it did nothing to satisfy the appetite of the revisionist powers for land, and in the end, it didn’t even matter, as war still arrived. To at least have a fighting chance, a massive effort will need to be undertaken by everyone to get every part of Britain into shape. To kickstart this effort, a new leadership was required, and it needed to be somebody that could inspire the British people and instill a never-say-die spirit among them. \n\nThat new leadership came in the form of Winston Churchill.\n\nServing in the Army as a young man, Churchill was also a war correspondent, writing about his experiences. Afterward, he became a politician and served in many governments, both as a Conservative and as a Liberal. Prior to his appointment as prime minister, Churchill was not popular among his fellow Tories, due to his defiant nature, but public support and aggressive anti-German rhetoric have propelled him into 10 Downing Street.\n\nNow, as Churchill takes control, the fate of Britain and the democracies of the world hangs in the balance. Will his steadfast determination and “bulldog” spirit break the tide of fascism, or will it not be enough, allowing the sun to set on the British Empire?

 # Canada
 Mackenzie_King_desc:0 "An intelligent individual, Mackenzie King acquired five university degrees in his youth and became deeply concerned with social welfare issues in Canada. In 1900, he was appointed to the office of Deputy Minister for Labour. During his time in the position, he became an MP for the Liberal Party. This success made King the first-ever Minister of Labour, but it all came crashing down when he lost his seat in parliament two years after, leading to King distancing himself from politics.\n\nAs the Great War wore on, the Liberal Party became fractured and divided over the issue of conscription, with many of its members defecting to the conservative coalition government. After the war and the death of the leader of the Liberals, King made a triumphant return to politics, filling the leadership gap, and made it his sole duty to reconcile the factions within and reunite the party, which was successful, as he led the Liberals to victory in the 1921 elections.\n\nAs the prime minister, he tried to lower ethnic tensions, deal with immigration, and expand the autonomy of the dominion within the Commonwealth. However, in the 1930 elections, King’s Liberals lost, as the Great Depression was rearing its head, and the economy was taking a beating.\n\nThe conservative government failed to deal with the crisis though, and after just one term, King has returned as prime minister. Now, he has a second chance at success, and if he is to bring Canada the prosperity it deserves, he will have to grab it with both hands."

 # Communist China
 Mao_Zedong_desc:0 "As son of a well off peasant family Mao draws his lineage and experiences from the strata of the Chinese society that will reveal to be the bedrock of his endeavours later in his life.  Born during the last dying breath of a decrepit empire the times ahead for China would be tough and filled with blood but they were also times of change, of social upheaval, of reform and reconstruction, times of Revolution. These were the exact thoughts of the youthful Mao Zedong  as he read book after book from the fields of his home to the libraries of Changsha, engulfing himself in ideologies and philosophical thought that most of the Chinese people couldn’t even fathom. While brutes and strongmen dominated China and oppressed the lower classes, thinking that their ubiquitous brutalities would continue to go unnoticed as it has in the past, a communion of social dissenters and intellectuals were gathering their strength. Indeed with the foundation of the Communist Party of China the tears of oppression and the cries for liberation of the common man finally had a face and following the betrayal of the cowardly nationalists of the Kuomintang, with the foundation of the Red Army, it had also gained a body of which Mao was a maximal exponent. Through his instrumental knowledge gained of the studies of such great minds as Napoleon and Sun Tzu Mao revealed himself not only to be an ideologue but also a mighty tactician. A guerrilla centric warfare style backed by discipline regimes of local peasants and banditry coupled with topographic knowledge proved to be more than enough to halt the advances of the Nationalists into the territories of the newly established Chinese Soviet Republic. With his incessant work towards the betterment of the people and the revolution Mao has proven himself to be a vibrant statesman and a cutthroat commander ascending him in his popularity and the ranks of the party. But the hard times are still ahead and it remains to be seen if he can lead the people towards a new China."
 Bo_Gu_desc:0 "They say that history can be a great teacher, and Bo Gu knows this. Being one of the 28 Bolsheviks who were inspired by the Soviet revolution, he knew that if he were to replicate the efforts of Moscow into China, the Chinese people would be liberated from the yolk of emperors who merely want to secure their own power, rather than the people's welfare. Of course, that was just in theory. Power politics does not end just because one believes in revolution, and Bo Gu had to make strides into winning his struggle. He won of course, but winning is different than maintaining. His leadership in the CCP is sloppy at best, with failures to capture cities from the KMT thugs, and the cracks are opening within his leadership. He needs to act now, or he shall be overtaken by more ambitious of men."

 # France
 Edouard_Daladier_desc:0 "In life, there will come a time where a man must make decisions that will make or break everything. This 'make or break' moment seems to be coming very soon for the current French Prime Minister, Edouard Daladier.\n\nDaladier was born in Vaucluse on 18 June 1884, the son of a village baker. He received education at the Lycée Duparc in Lyon, where he was first introduced to socialist politics. At the start of the Great War, he was mobilized into the French Army as a sergeant. In 1916 he fought in the Battle of Verdun, being given a field commission as a Lieutenant and receiving multiple medals, including the Legion of Honor. His broad stature and his heroics in the face of danger gave him the nickname 'Bull of Vaucluse'.\n\nAfter entering the Chamber of Deputies as the representative for Vaucluse, he became a leading member of the Radical-Socialist Party - leading it since 1920 and bringing it to the status of the most notable left-wing party in France. The many attempts of creating a broad republican-left front upon which France could run have finally paid off, with the foundation of the said coalition on the 18th December 1932.\n\nHowever, his rise has not been without hindrance. The rise of the French Far Right and the Far-Right leagues have placed a thorn in his side, with their populist rhetoric bringing more and more support to their side. Should they gain much more power, they may be able to bring down the Republic as a whole - the Army leaning towards siding with these thuggish anti-republicans.\n\nDaladier stands, a bastion of Republicanism in a rising wave of reactionary fury. Will he stand strong, or will the tricolor be torn from its flagpost once more?"
 
 # Germany
 Adolf_Hitler_desc:0 "“Sic Parvis Magna” Do you know what it means?\n\nIt's Latin, meaning "Greatness from small beginnings." It means that anyone, even in the lowest in the ladder, can achieve anything they so desire should they put the will to it. We only need to look at the man who holds this entire leader description.\n\nBefore Hindenburg appointed Hitler to one of the highest offices of the land, he was a mere nobody. A small-time failed artist in Vienna, he was declined from every single art school throughout Austria, citing the lack of artistic expression and seeing it nothing more as "detailed architect concepts." This is excluding the fact that his education is abysmal, and his father would often employ corporal punishment for his failures. However, in crisis comes opportunities, and opportunities come indeed.\nAs Hitler sells art in the streets, he often watches from afar the speeches of Anti-Semites in Vienna, analyzing their rhetoric and their ingenious use of language and speech towards captivating the audience, along with adapting their philosophies. When the Weltkrieg started, he went to Germany and was enlisted as a soldier of the Heer. There he gained connections from within, and after the war, he found the perfect opportunity - converting shame into anger, defeatism into nationalism. \nYear after year, he consolidated his power within the crumbling Weimar Republic, establishing connections from all sides of the political spectrum, from Junkers to military officers to even the common people. One of them was Hindenburg who, after being backed into a corner, reluctantly appointed Hitler so as to combat the rising tide of Leftism. However, Hindenburg is a feeble, weak man. His days are numbered, and once Hindenburg dies, Hitler will have the power.\n\nThe question is what future does the Deutschland await?"
 Wilhelm_II_desc:0 "You don’t often get a second chance at governing a nation, especially if you failed the first time. When you fail on a scale as large as Wilhelm II did, second chances are extremely rare; but that is exactly what he has gotten. A second chance.\n\nPrior to the war, the Kaiser pursued massive naval expansion plans in an attempt to build a navy that could rival the Royal Navy, strengthening the army and growing the German economy rapidly, which eventually it the strongest in continental Europe. Despite these improvements, Germany still lost the war- this resulting in Wilhelm's abdication of both the Imperial and Prussian crowns and his subsequent exile to the Netherlands, where he planned to stay for the rest of his life. Except he didn’t.\n\nThe turmoil in Germany that followed the end of the war was devastating, and the issues that the new federal republic faced were too much to bear. It was then dissolved and replaced with a government-run by people who only dragged Germany further down the wrong path. Many army officers became discontent with this government and decided to take drastic action. This resulted in Wilhelm’s return, who was chosen over his son, the crown prince.\n\nCurrently, the old Kaiser is nothing but a puppet under the thumb of the military. If he is to make the best of this second chance and make use of his vast experience, he will need to establish his authority as the rightful ruler of Germany and restore Prussian constitutionalism. However, if he can’t put the army in its place, he will be nothing but a powerless figurehead..."
 Wilhelm_III_desc:0 "It is often said that a man pays for the sins of his father, and of this, there is no better proof than the Young Wilhelm, former Crown Prince of Prussia, now Kaiser of the German Empire.\n\nHis very birth was used by his father as a means to spite his British relatives, refusing to take a British physician to secure a safe birth - one having failed for the old Wilhelm. Instead, he asked his aunt Helena to secure a safe birth, which shortly followed on the 6th of May, 1882.\n\nIn his early life, the prince very much followed the Prussian Military Noble style of living, heading to a military academy and joining the army as his father had. Wilhelm had been active in pushing German expansion prior to the Great War and sought a leading role in the outbreak of war. Despite being only thirty-two and having never commanded a unit larger than a regiment, the Crown Prince of Prussia was named commander of the 5th Army in August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the Weltkrieg. \n\nHis father's ineptitude led to the usurpation of power from the monarchy to the Weimar Republic and thus forcing the monarchy to abdicate, but Wilhelm was not deterred -  returning to Germany in 1923 with the intent of being active in politics once more. Wilhelm's support for the DNVP and military factions guaranteed that when they couped the failed Republic, he was immediately placed back upon the throne to lead Deutschland once more.\n\nYoung Wilhelm can at last right the wrongs his father made, giving Germany its rightful place in the sun once more.\n\nFür Kaiser, Gott und Vaterland!"
 Paul_von_Hindenburg_desc:0 "Nostalgia is a powerful emotion. It drives us to the ends of the earth for us to restore the glorious past of old right here, right now. Yet as powerful as it may be, it can drive a man to his destruction. \n\nEnter Paul von Hindenburg, a decorated officer of the German Army who wanted to firmly place the Reich as equals to the empires of Britain and France, perhaps even more. He yearned for the Kaiserreich's power to be unquestioned and unbowed, becoming the hegemon of the world under the tutelage of the Prussian Eagle. Despite everything he did, even risking his prestige and power within the Reich, he ultimately failed to secure the Reich's "Place in the Sun" that the Kaiser longed for and was ultimately removed from the pedestals of power.\n\nFate had different plans for Hindenburg however, and despite adamant opposition and his stained reputation, he has bestowed another chance to rule Germany under the guise of Reichsprasident. Mimicking the authoritarian rule during the Weltkrieg, he passed legislation at a whim, dissolved the Reichstag whenever he pleases and appointed who he decided to be his Reichskanzler. For a moment, it seemed that Hindenburg finally had a chance to restore order in the tumultuous Republic and finally finish what he started so long ago.\n\nHowever, no man can avoid the Reaper's scythe and his window was closing. Day after day, he became more senile and forgetful - traits that are not associated with leadership. He had to act now before his luck runs out. He could've given the power to the SPD but they were always at odds with Hindenburg ever since his days as a Prussian officer. He could've given the power to other parties, but they lacked the seats to back up their position. Cornered, Hindenburg had no choice - he had to give power to the NSDAP, the one-party he was somewhat willing to empower despite his bitter relationship with their leader, Hitler.\n\nHistory will judge if Hindenburg did make the right decision..."
 Erwin_Rommel_desc:0 "A soldier who dedicates his life for his country is often rewarded with many things - welfare, lifestyle, respect - but rarely do soldiers get rewarded with an entire nation under their grip.\n\nThat is until the Desert Fox got his hands on one himself.\n\nErwin Rommel was no ordinary soldier of the Reich - he served the Kaiser, served the Republic, and now serves the Fuhrer. Every time he leads, he brings favorable results with haste. Poland, France, Africa - all faced the might and terror of the Desert Fox, falling one by one to his supreme strategems. Once the Panzers started landing on the streets of New York and Washington, not even the American Army could endure the tactical and strategic superiority of Erwin Rommel's Forces.\n\nThe dust has settled and America is now under the Reich's banner. It was assumed that Rommel would end his duties in North America and finally settle in his residence in Germany - however, the Fuhrer had other plans. The Fuhrer entrusted Rommel with the most important task of all - controlling America and firmly placing it under the Reich's rule. As an added bonus, the Fuhrer gave Rommel the greatest promotion that could ever happen in his lifetime - the rank of Reichsmarschall.\n\nWith the unwavering support of the Fuhrer, Rommel will do whatever it takes to ensure America falls firmly under the Reich's banner. The task is difficult, for America is a vast region built on rebellion and liberty - it intends to rebel against the Reich by any means necessary. However, when all is said and done, the German flag will be the only one flying among the rubble of the Rust Belt.\n\nEmpires rise and fall - but America's Empire fell before it ever began..."
 Ernst_Rohm_desc:0 "A violent, aggressive, and cruel man, Ernst Rohm has been through a lot. Once a close friend of Adolf Hitler, Rohm led the Sturmabteilung until becoming disillusioned with his old friend and his decisions. Rohm then overthrew Hitler, and now finds himself in charge of a new Germany.\n\nEarlier in his life, Rohm had a successful career in the army, receiving a medal for his service in the First World War. He was a frontline soldier before sustaining a wound that forced him to become an officer. Rohm then retired from the army five years after the war, during which he joined the NSDAP.\n\nLater, Rohm became frustrated with the party leaders' decisions not to accept his proposals related to the legal alternative to the SA, which was banned. Rohm then resigned, left Germany, and became an advisor to the Bolivian army. But the ban was lifted a few years later. At the behest of Hitler, Rohm returned to lead the Sturmabteilung and implement his radical ideas. \n\nAfter Hitler gained complete control of Germany and all opposition was quashed by the SA, Rohm and much of his militia advocated for a “Second” Revolution, one which would benefit the working class and fight against capitalism. \n\nThis Second Revolution has become a reality. Hitler and his cronies have been removed, and the Sturmabteilung now rules the streets. But Rohm’s regime is weak, and if it is to survive, he will need to legitimize it in the eyes of the people and empower his greatest tool, the SA.""
 Gregor_Strasser_desc:0 "The bane of the bourgeoise has been described as many different men. From men of steel in the East to men of words in the West, the world stays divided on what the true revolution really is. Germany, the true heart of Europe, has brought forth a different man - a breaker of the false dichotomy, rejecter of the social left degeneracy, and bringer of the German Worker's Liberation - Gregor Strasser. \n\n Gregor Strasser was born in 1892, the older of two brothers - himself and Otto Strasser. He went through the average middle-class German upbringing, going through school, getting decent grades and eventually becoming an apprentice pharmacist in the Bavarian village of Frontenhausen. During the Great War, he went to officer school, entered into an artillery regiment and eventually rose to the rank of Oberleutnant and earned an Iron Cross for his brave deeds. \n\n After joining the Freikorps along side his brother and Heinrich Himmler after the war, he took part in the failed 1920 Kapp Putsch, which Otto had switched sides from and gone against - having joined the left-wing. Eventually, both of the Strasser brothers came to an agreement on politics - joining the NSDAP, beginning to turn it into a fervently anti-capitalist cause. Over the cause of the next decade - through the fall of the party in 23' and rise again in 25' and all the way to now, the Strasser brothers have kept the flame of the Revolution going in spite of the reactionary forces within the party led by Hitler himself."

 # Italy
 Benito_Mussolini_desc:0 "A country in shambles. Its people angry, its economy on the downturn, and so much blood paid for such little gain. This was Italy following the Great War. The people looked everywhere, looking for a change - someone who could channel their anger for those who betrayed them and make their nation great and prosperous again. They were looking for a true savior of Italia.\n\nOut of the political chaos that ensued, one man walked out of it, offering the Italian people their dreams - an Italy that could match the biggest and best nations - a land complete that would get back the rightful territory it earned in the Great War and was not given.\n\nThis man was Benito Mussolini, the Iron Prefect - and soon to be 'Il Duce'.\n\nMussolini is a former socialist, turned by his experience of rejection from the Socialist Party and his servitude in the Royal Italian Army into an avid nationalist. Something defined him beyond that, however - his speak of a national 'sprit', his talk of rejecting falsehoods placed by the modern world - all this was seen and heard by a nation that yearned for vengeance, leading to the March on Rome in 1922 and a brutal consolidation of power over the following years.\n\nWith the new system of Fascism now firmly in place and the trains running on time, Italy stands at a crossroads. Can Mussolini bring the glory he so professed to the Italian people to his nation, or will his system wither and crumble like the Roman Empire that he so looks up to?\n\nWhatever the case, Il Duce stands in the face of the coming storm... and no one knows what it will bring."


 # Soviet Union
 Joseph_Stalin_desc:0 "Leadership often requires many things - charisma, will, diplomacy, strategy - these things often are refined and softened as decades go by, for politics is a gentleman's game wherein such crude methods of torture, assassination, or murder have no place in the world. Only a few brave yet very bold souls would dare go back to such primitive forms of governance - such as Joseph Stalin.\nBorn to an impoverished yet religious family, Stalin seems like the least likely person to inherit a nation like Russia. Yet, fate works in mysterious ways, and Stalin surprisingly gained a golden opportunity. He was able to get his hands on a book, with teachings very much countering the ones that are taught in his very school - revolution and socialism. Over time, he got more and more dedicated to the revolution, albeit at the cost of his grades and his standing in his class. This did not matter for Stalin, for he saw it as a means to an end.\nAnd it was worth the gamble, for he finally got his chance to ascend to the higher echelons of the Party, becoming close to Vladimir Lenin. He became point-man for the various "less-than-legal" operations of the Party, such as robbery and extortion. His extremist and radical approaches weren't exactly liked by the Party, so they tried to isolate him, however as they isolate him, it actually does the opposite - it makes him more popular than ever.\nAs the dust settles and the revolution is a success however, the true power play starts. Lenin never considered Stalin as the successor, yet with politicking and strategy, Stalin rose to the top of the food chain, with Trotsky side-lined. Stalin's rule is nothing but brutal - his insistence on rapid industrialization has ended in misery, with famine rampant and even bodies left in the streets alone. However, Stalin's rule is under threat, with many factions aiming to take him down. There is only one thing certain:\n“In Soviet Russia, the Bear pokes you”"
 Sergey_Kirov_desc:0 "If there is one man to be the poster child of the Soviet Man, that image would be Sergei Mironovich Kirov. He personifies the attributes that any Soviet should emulate:“ solider, friend, and loyal supporter of the Revolution.”\n Born on March 27, 1886, in Urzhum, Kirov has been instrumental to the rise of the Petrograd Soviet and the success of the October Revolution and the civil war that followed. Kirov led Bolshevik forces in Astrakhan and the battles waged in that area up until 1920. \n\nAfter the civil war, Kirov took up leadership of the Azerbaijani Communist Party in 1921 and quickly developed a loyalty to Joseph Stalin. Because of this loyalty, Kirov had been gifted the secretary position of the Leningrad City Committee, more commonly known as a mayorship, in 1926. He had continued to be a loyal supporter of Joseph Stalin, though this loyalty might be tested if Stalin were to betray this trust. Will Kirov be able to bring forth new dawn for the everyday worker, or will he just be swept aside into the dustbin of history, never to be mentioned in the textbooks of the future?"



 # United States
 Franklin_Roosevelt_desc:0 "The Great Depression has caused much pain for the American people, and it doesn’t seem like the pain will be ending soon. Throughout the country, wages have dropped, workers have been laid off and homelessness is rising.\n\nThe previous administration's attempts to stimulate the economy and restore confidence in the financial system were ineffective, and often had the opposite effect of what was desired. This lost the confidence of the American people in the government, leading to an overwhelming vote in favor of the first Democratic candidate since Woodrow Wilson.\n\nThat man was Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Born in New York, and distantly related to former president Theodore Roosevelt, he started his political career as a state senator before becoming Assistant Secretary for the Navy. But, in 1921, tragedy struck when Roosevelt was diagnosed with polio. Paralyzed from the waist down, it took him away from politics for years.\nRoosevelt wouldn’t let his career end there, however. He fought hard to make a comeback, and finally succeeded when he became the governor of New York, a post that he held until his current one as commander-in-chief of the United States of America.\n\nAs president, Roosevelt will attempt to revitalize the American economy and begin to drag the country out of the Great Depression by enacting a series of programs called the New Deal. Whether it will work is anyone’s guess, but at the very least he has brought something new to American politics, and hope to the American people..."

 # Japan
 Hirohito_desc:0 "They say that in silence, power is devoid and meaningless. No matter how much power you have physically, legally, or in any other factor, if you do not wield it at all, it is meaningless.\n\nThat is the unfortunate reality of the Showa Emperor, a man whose lineage is divine to its core, and whose perception is that of a deity to the people of Nihon. His whole life, he has been dictated on what to do, not able to voice out an opinion nor speak his mind, only to condone and accept the consequences. He has listened faithfully to his small council of officers, people who have made a mockery of the Showa, using his divine will as a means to attain uncontested power within Nihon. With all the power, wealth, and glory of the world, the Showa remains silent on issues that define his nation, merely approving them on a whim. As he signs a treaty to disarm and promote peace, he gives carte blanche on an incursion to Manchuria.\n\nThe question is, will the Showa Emperor finally use the divine will that his ancestors have been cultivating for centuries? Or remain silent forever and allow others to use him as a ploy for their plans..."
 Saito_desc:0 "Compromise, Experience, Connections, and Luck.\n\nThese were the things that ascended Makoto to the highest echelons of Tokyo's government. He was not the first choice by any means, nor was he supposed to gain power. After the death of his predecessor, Nihon needed a new face, one that could stem the tides of the military, while also preserving the civilian government. With pressure mounting, the Emperor chose to appoint Makoto to power, due to a variety of enticing reasons:\n\nHe was a man of the military, most specifically the Navy, which served as a great counterbalance to the overarching influence of the IJA. He had experience governing, with his stint in Chosen showing that he could provide action and serve as a unifying Prime Minister who can prevent the military from taking matters into his own hands. Along with his connections being a privy councillor, he was the perfect candidate, in the right place and in the right time. Almost too perfect for a candidate, some may say.\n\nThe question is, is he really the saviour that Nihon needs? Or does he have a black spot in his reputation..."


 # South Africa
 JBM_Hertzog_desc:0 "A general in the Second Boer War, J.B.M Hertzog was renowned for his daring and resourcefulness while leading his guerrilla forces. Despite wanting to fight on, Hertzog was persuaded to end the bloodshed and restore peace to the cape.\n\nPrior to Hertzog’s entrance into politics after the war, he sustained a “South Africa First” stance, wishing the country to be free from foreign control. This nationalist attitude carried over when he became the Minister of Justice, which often created tension with his fellow politicians. This resulted in him being left out of the new government that was formed in 1912.\n\nHowever, Hertzog didn’t give up. Instead, he formed the National Party, which gained a substantial following throughout the Great War, as it opposed the support that the Union government gave the British.\n\nThis opposition was successful, as in the 1924 general election, Hertzog’s National Party formed a coalition government with the Labour Party, and came into power. After many social and economic improvements for working-class whites, the National Party were the victors once again in the subsequent election. Hertzog’s second term resulted in further social and economic advances for the white minority.\n\nDespite his constant neglect for the colored majority, Hertzog has won a third term as Prime Minister of the Union. If he hopes to win a fourth, he will need to navigate these increasingly turbulent times without compromising his policy of promoting South African independence from the British Empire..."
 DF_Malan_desc:0 "Daniel François Malan was born on the 22nd of May 1874, he was more commonly known as D. F. Malan, he is a South African politician. Malan was born in Riebeek-West in the Cape Colony. The progenitor of the Malan name in the South African region was a French Huguenot refugee named Jacques Malan from Provence (Mérindol), France, who arrived at the Cape before 1689. The Malan name is one of a number of Afrikaans names of French origin which have retained their original spelling. Malan's involvement in National Party politics began shortly after the NP's formation in 1914. In those years, political parties had affiliated newspapers that served as their mouthpiece.\nHowever, Nationalist-minded Afrikaners in the Cape had no such outlet and in the Cape had no such outlet and therefore, in 1915, decided to found De Burger, which later became known as Die Burger.  He is truly a charismatic leader unlike any other and in addition to that, he also is a great world statesman. Our people can only hope he shall lead steer us to glory and make us the master on the African continent. "

 ROM_HoS_Mihai_I_desc:0 "The young king now is on the throne once more but his ability to reign has waned away completely thanks to the wretched war, his father’s incompetence, and the Mareșal’s ambitions. Not to say that he used to have political clout and now he no longer holds it. The truth is that ever since his first coronation he has been powerless and a victim of his circumstances, like a ragdoll in the hands of a pouty child, Michael has been used as a pretty face to look at for those around him for their own gain and that remains unchanged to this day. The king is merely but a figurehead to give legitimacy to Antonescu’s regime and a figure to rally the people behind, but the years after the war has seen a decline of that role as the Mareșal’s war exploits have spiked his popularity amongst the masses; still Michael continued to appear alongside Antonescu at public meetings, national holidays and other joyous occasions but every time the young king’s role seems to be reduced more and more despite the fact that he’s the de jure holder of the executive power in the country, every time he seems to retreat more into the shadows and appear more like a mythical figure rather than a tangible person.\n\nIndeed his situation is dire, he’s watched by Antonescu’s hounds wherever he is and his lack of experience allows a superficial naïveté to seep through whenever he interacts with public figures or perhaps that’s what he wants to let on. Michael, while inexperienced is still a youthful man with more than half of his life still ahead of him, to sit in a catatonic state waiting to die, would be very uncharacteristic of such a strapping young man. The great Conducător’s eyes can’t be everywhere all at once and his leadership isn’t appreciated by everyone leaving Michael ample opportunity to use his own sharp wits and contacts to potentially lever the situation in his own favor despite the close control in his regard. Yet he knows that he can’t do anything right now so he bides his time. He waits, but only time will tell if his wait will pay off."

The ability for you to sleep peacefully at night with your door open, knowing that no one will break into your home? The ability for you to conduct your business ventures freely with out fearing theft or arson? That is what everyone desires in life, the ability to feel safe and secure, protected from chaos and anarchy that will give rise to terror and fear. Leaders should keep their citizens secure and safe, someone to look up to for their salvation amidst terror and evil that sweeps the land.\n\nEnter Chiang Kai Shek, a man of action who embodies everything that citizens ask for. A military man and one of the rising powers in the Kuomintang, Chiang Kai Shek adheres to the Three Principles of the People, yet he knows perfectly, that this benevolent and ambitious philosophy cannot be achieved, without China being stabilized and under the political tutelage of the KMT. He knows by heart that no other political organization, neither the Communists and their wretched supporters in the KMT, nor the Japanese and their "Xuantong Emperor" can achieve Dr. Sun's vision for China. Only through the rule of the KMT, excluding the Leftist wing, can China truly become what it should be. \n\nHowever, Chiang has his own problems to contend to. Many in the KMT, especially Wang Jingwei and his Left-KMT, believe that Chiang is merely a political exploiter, using crises to fuel his political gain. Not only this, warlords still rule China, and the looming threat of the Communists and the Japanese remain, all wanting to destroy China for their own ambitions.\n\nChiang shall either rule China or shall destroy China. Simple as that."

Wang believes in one thing - appeasement. He knows very well that Chiang's attitude would merely satiate Japan's lust for war, and only through caving to their needs, by appeasing them and diplomatically negotiating with them, can China be saved.\n\nHowever, the real question arises - Will this be China's salvation?

After all, why blame a General if he was ordered by his so-called "commander-in-chief"?\n\nHowever, just like Pinocchio, he desires freedom, he desires to have no strings on himself.

 # Turkey
 Fezvi_cakmak_desc:0 "The death of President Atatürk has left a void in the country’s leadership. Without him, the possibility of a great, independent Turkey is left in doubt. To fill this void, strong leadership is required, something that Ismet Inönü simply cannot provide. Thankfully the Grand National Assembly saw that and chose the superior candidate. Fevzi Çakmak, Chief of General Staff, Field Marshal and Independence War veteran, is the new president. \n\nDespite the change in leadership, corruption and disloyalty in politics has remained and has been exacerbated by the death of Atatürk. This will provide a substantial obstacle that Çakmak will have to traverse if he is to implement his altered version of the late president’s ideas and beliefs, which sticks more to his roots and is centred around policies that focus more on developing the currently inadequate military while also placing extra emphasis upon the nationalist elements of Atatürk’s vision. \n\n Apart from the extra focus on the military and nationalism, Çakmak also doesn’t share the same desire of putting power into the hands of the people that Atatürk had, and will not waste his time making a third attempt at executing a multi-party system. He will reinvest that time into other areas that need further development if Turkey is to catch up with the Western world. \n\n Çakmak believes that he is the right man to lead Turkey into a prosperous future, but as tensions are rising across Europe, the slightest misstep could spell catastrophe for the country and destroy everything that Atatürk built, and what he is trying to build upon."

 Ismet_Inonu_desc:0 "The Turkish people are grieving. President Atatürk’s untimely death is unfortunate, and now his vision for a modern, secular Turkey could be put in jeopardy. In an effort to provide an easy transition in leadership and continue progressing towards achieving the late president’s goals, the Grand National Assembly saw only one choice when naming his successor, former prime minister Ismet Inönü. \n\nApart from his new title of President, Inönü has also been given the title of “Millî Şef”, or “National Chief” due to his new position as head of the Republican People’s Party, the only political party in the country. The lack of a political spectrum was something that Atatürk tried to fix, but unfortunately couldn’t due to a high level of corruption that Inönü now has to grapple with. \n\nAs a result of this corruption, it will take time for the new president to implement a multi-party system that will last, and continue to modernise and democratise Turkey in line with Atatürk’s vision. This may all be in vain, however, as tensions are rising throughout Europe, and the prospects of a large-scale war are edging closer and closer to reality, and due to Turkey’s ideal geographical location, is being pressured by both sides to join them.\n\nBut despite this, Inönü will try to stand firm. He will do anything to preserve and protect this country, and won’t risk the future of everything he and Atatürk have built by taking sides in the brewing storm... Will his gamble at neutrality work out, or will it be the downfall of this young republic?"

 Kemal_Ataturk_desc:0 "An Ottoman field marshal during the First World War, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk rose to prominence due to his role in the Ottoman Empire’s victory in the Battle of Gallipoli. Following its defeat in the war, the sultanate accepted an armistice and the Treaty of Sèvres, allowing the partitioning of the empire and even parts of Anatolia itself. \n\nIn response to this, the Turkish National Movement was formed, with Atatürk at its helm. The movement rebelled against the Treaty, which led to the War of Independence and ended with the victory of the movement, the abolishment of the sultanate, the formation of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, and Atatürk as the first President of the Republic. \n\nHe then proceeded with a massive reconstruction of the political, educational and cultural systems, aiming to create a modern, secular country. To help protect the young republic from the destabilising influences of foreign ideologies, Atatürk implemented a one-party system and intended for it to be temporary. But both attempts at creating a multi-party state ended in failure. Despite this setback, Atatürk pushed on with his reforms, which included the creation of a new Turkish alphabet, a modified version of its Latin counterpart. \n\nAtatürk has made great progress in his attempt at reforming Turkey, but he is facing strong opposition from greedy and corrupt politicians that deny the need for change. However, if he succeeds, and reinvents Turkey, he will go down in history as a great man. \n\nBut the question remains, can he do it?"

During his time as a soldier in the Ottoman army, he was a gunnery officer and spent his initial battles suppressing revolts throughout the now long-gone empire. He eventually rose to the rank of Colonel during the Great War, where he met his future president, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk on the frontlines. \n\nAfter experiencing defeat at the Battle of Megiddo, Inönü was sent back to Istanbul and was made the Undersecretary of the Ministry of War, and after that, General Secretary of the Documentation in the Military Council. Shortly after the end of the war and the subsequent occupation of Constantinople by Allied forces as part of the treaty signed by the sultanate, Inönü joined the Turkish National Movement, where he reunited with Atatürk. \n\nAssigned to the Western Front of the war, Inönü led his forces to victory and was made the Chief Negotiator for the Turkish delegation, proving his immense diplomatic ability by squeezing concessions out of his counterparts at the negotiating table. This persuaded Atatürk to appoint Inönü, his friend, his “brother,” to the position of Prime Minister when the Republic was established. \n\nNow, Inönü works tirelessly to fight against corrupt politicians and help implement the vision that Atatürk has for a new Turkey, one with a prosperous future, free from the flaws of the old Ottoman Empire."

Shortly after the conclusion of Shawkat's studies in 1909, his father was elected to the Ottoman parliament, allowing Naji the opportunity to attend law school in Istanbul. Shawkat served as Assistant General Prosecutor in al-Hila until the outbreak of the Great War, joining the Ottoman army as a reservist in 1915. After two years of fighting in the Mesopotamian campaign, Shawkat was captured and joined the Arab Revolt led by the Sharif of Mecca, Hussein ibn Ali al-Hashimi. \n\nFollowing the resignation of Nuri as-Said in 1932, Faisal I- Hussein's son and King of Iraq- asked Shawkat to accept the post of Prime Minister and lead a non-partisan compromise cabinet unbound by the factionalism brought on by the signing of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty and capable of restoring stability to the troubled country. \n\nShawkat faces immense opposition from anti-treaty nationalists such as Rashid Ali Al-Gaylani's Party of National Brotherhood, as well as much of the existing political elite and factions within the army. If the Shawkat government is to survive, it will take deft maneuvering of the volatile Iraqi political scene."

 Faisal_I_desc:0 "There were many people, that lived in the Ottoman empire, many people that in the time of the Sultans would have been considered insignificant. Simple embers in a fire far greater than themselves, inevitably drowning in the mass of similar individuals. But often in times of crises, even the mightiest of flames gets pushed to its limits and then burns out. Then only the embers remain, most of them dying themselves shortly after the flame extinguishes. But a select few are carried away by the wind or by chance, find timber, and starting a new fire by themselves. As in Faisal`s case, the collapse of the Ottomans was the wind and the angry Arabs were his tinder, while he was the ember, that started a new fire and allowed him to become a leading figure in the ranks of the Arab Revolt. \n\nAs it continued, however, Faisal became disillusioned. Deciding that he wanted an empire for himself, he engaged in backroom dealing with the Ottoman side, stating that he would be willing to defect if he was given significant territory to rule — he was denied. This put in danger the positive, “faithful friend” image that was shown to the Entente, so he put an end to his pragmatic scheming. After the end of the Great War, Faisal’s appetite for territory was satiated, as he was made the king of Syria. This didn’t last long, however, as he was expelled from the country after experiencing defeat in the Franco-Syrian War — a small setback, as he was installed as the king of British-mandated Iraq soon after. Maintaining positive relations with Britain while pursuing his pan-Arab agenda was no easy task, but through his pragmatic nature and ability to negotiate effectively, he eventually achieved some degree of independence for his country. \n\nWith the situation in Iraq and around the World changing, Faisal I is now closer than ever to turning his pan-Arab dream into reality, though he must remain patient, as there is still a long way to go, and one wrong move could destroy his entire work."

 Manuel_Azana_Diaz_desc:0 "In the vivid and chaotic politics of Spain of the 2nd decade of the 19th century, a young man by the name of Manuel Azaña tirelessly indulges himself in the debates and speeches of the Ateneo de Madrid, passionately arguing with Spain's most educated intellectuals and writers, wrestling over how to proceed with reform. A word that would accompany him for his whole life. An avid admirer of France and its politics Azaña goes on to embrace the french republican system and what he sees as the only way to bring into Spain a real democracy and a state of equals under one flag.\nThe black years of Primo de Rivera's dictatorship only serve to embold and solidify his ideological position. A believer in the necessity of deep reforms, he wastes no time and commences his first projects in 1931, acting as a magnet between socialists, republicans and the bourgeoisie. Faced with ever deepening problems and a consequent civil war that will lead his dear republic to its demise, Manuel Azaña's legacy is one of a man embraced with the modern visions of his times and one of the not so many believers in the functioning of a democratic, equal, and solid republic."
