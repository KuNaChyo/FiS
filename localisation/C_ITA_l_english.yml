 DH_Italy.1.t:0 "Fall of Fascist Italy"
 DH_Italy.1.d:0 "Mussolini has been removed out of office by the Italian government, throwing Italy in turmoil. The defection of Rome presents us with a dilemma: we either fight on under German leadership, with only the north of Italy under our control, or we submit defeat and hope for lenient punishment from the western powers."
 DH_Italy.1.a:0 "Death before Dishonour!"
 DH_Italy.1.b:0 "Down with Fascism!"

 DH_Italy.2.t:0 "Alpine Territorial Exchange"
 DH_Italy.2.d:0 "It appears that Germany's ambitions regarding the Tyrol have not died just yet. One of their diplomats have come to propose an exchange of territory: the Italian speaking parts of Switzerland shall be ceded in return for the hand over of South Tyrol. On its face the trade seems reasonable since it would adhere more closely to the language border."
 DH_Italy.2.a:0 "No, South Tyrol is Italian."
 DH_Italy.2.b:0 "We agree to the exchange"

 DH_Italy.3.t:0 "The Cyprus Offer"
 DH_Italy.3.d:0 "Germany has approached us with a lucrative offer of occupying the island of Cyprus. By turning the island into a naval base, Italy's dominance in the eastern Mediterranean will surely grow. However, the large Turkish population might cause trouble administering the region."
 DH_Italy.3.a:0 "Mare Nostrum - Our Sea"
 DH_Italy.3.b:0 "We have enough naval bases"

 DH_Italy.4.t:0 "Germany Takes Paris"
 DH_Italy.4.d:0 "With the fall of Paris to the German Forces perhaps it's time to look past our dislike for Hitler and join the axis"
 DH_Italy.4.a:0 "Indeed"
 DH_Italy.4.b:0 "Italy First!"

 DH_Italy.5.t:0 "The March of the Iron Will"
 DH_Italy.5.d:0 "Those wretched Ethiopians, who so long ago brought shame to the Italian nation, have been struck down at last by the Iron Will of Fascism. The Ethiopians fought with spears and shields as the steel and lead of the Regio Esercito brought them to their knees. As the people of Addis Ababa looked on, great columns of trucks, tanks, and horses marched unopposed into their capital, truly demonstrating our superiority. The people of Italy celebrate the expansion of the Italian Empire, and our regime is solidified at home and abroad."
 DH_Italy.5.a:0 "La vittoria è nostra!"

 DH_Italy.5.t:0 "D'Annunzio's Death"
 DH_Italy.5.d:0 "Gabriele d'Annunzio, a great fascist and one whose ideas have inspired Il Duce himself, has died today from a stroke. His accomplishments are many: his writings shaped modern Italian fascism, his novels inspired thousands of Italians, and his storied Flight over Vienna gave courage to the hearts of many during the bloody battles along the Isonzo. The nation mourns the loss of a true war hero and, although he and Mussolini had been rivals these past years, he was given a state funeral and honored by our leader. Il Vate, or The Poet, has been interred in a white marble tomb at Il Vittoriale degli Italiani, a museum at his birthplace commemorating his life. D'Annunzio will be remembered in all of our hearts as a patriot who fought for the glory of our proud nation, even in death."
 DH_Italy.5.a:0 "Requiescat in Pace.""

What can stop the zeal, the strength of the uncontrollable force of nature that is youth? Who can deny that the best time of a man’s life is when he’s at the peak of his virility and energies? \n\nA nation is not made by the decrepit old hierarchs of the times gone; it is not made by old men who have got but time to sit contently upon their thrones watching over their past deeds, constantly clinging onto them as if they still represent what they are now, failing to realize that the sands of time have already ran through their fingers and it is now the time of a new era. \n\nThis era will be brought about by the unrelenting forces and hope of the youth, forwards is the only direction and there is no looking back! It is the way of the future, it is the way of Italy as it stands against the plutocratic nations, it is the way of the Italian as he remakes himself into a new man and sculpts his future with his own hands. Avanti! Avanti! AVANTI!"

 ITA_The_Corporatist_Experiment_desc:0 "“Tutto nello Stato, niente al di fuori dello Stato, nulla contro lo Stato” \n\nAlthough the concept of “corporation” in the traditional sense of its meaning is not a new concept by any means in the history of Italy, it has never seen such a massive structural renovation in all its aspects and widespread application until the implementation of the PNF’s economic policies. \n\nThe Corporatist model aims, in spite of the marauding Capitalist one and the freedom depriving Communist one, to bring the entirety of society under the wing of Fascism, the workers and the employers work together not for personal gains but for the common good of the nation under the ever-watchful eye of the state. At least in theory.\n\nThe system while not unsuccessful has plenty of problems associated with the preference of political gain and silencing of dissent over the efficiency of production, yet it remains as a contender against western production systems in the tumultuous times of the post-New York stock market crash."
