 POR_SS_equipment_1912_desc:0 "The Portuguese Foca-class represented three small submarines built in Italy for the Portuguese Navy shortly after World War I. They were enlarged versions of the Italian Espadarte-class and the sister ships of the Spanish A-class. They displaced only 260 tons and were armed with two 450mm torpedo tubes. All three ships were decommissioned by the mid-1930s."
 POR_SS_equipment_1916:0 "Delfim Class"
 POR_SS_equipment_1916_desc:0 "The Delfim-class consisted of a pair of submarines originally ordered and laid down in Italy for the Portuguese Navy in the early 1930s. The order was cancelled and they ships were instead completed for the Italian Navy. They were based on the large, Italian Squalo-class, displacing 980 tons and armed with eight 533mm torpedo tubes."
 POR_SS_equipment_1933:0 "Narval Class"
 POR_SS_equipment_1933_desc:0 "The Narval-class consisted of three British Subtle-class submarines that were commissioned in 1945 and sold to Portugal after World War II. They displaced 840 tons and were armed with seven 533mm torpedo tubes."
 POR_DD_equipment_1900:0 "Douro Class"
 POR_DD_equipment_1900_desc:0 "The Douro-class was a-class of seven destroyers launched in the early 1930s. They were built in both Portugal and the U.K. Two of the ships were sold to Colombia in 1934. The ships displaced over 1,200 tons and were armed with four BL 4.7 in. guns and eight 533mm torpedo tubes."
 ### PRU - PERU ###
 PRU_SS_equipment_1912:0 "R Class"
 PRU_SS_equipment_1912_desc:0 "The Peruvian R-class submarines consisted of four subs ordered from and built by the U.S. in the mid-1920s. They were essentially identical to the U.S. R-class submarines, displacing over 570 tons and armed with four 533mm torpedo tubes."
 PRU_DD_equipment_1900:0 "Almirante Villar Class"
 PRU_DD_equipment_1900_desc:0 "The Almirante Villar and Amirante Guise were two former Russian Novik-class destroyers. They had a roundabout path to the Peruvian Navy, sailing under the flags of both the U.K. and Estonia before finally being delivered to Peru in 1934. They were armed with four 102mm/60 caliber guns and nine 533mm torpedo tubes. They displaced over 1,200 tons and had decent speed for their size and vintage."
 PRU_CL_equipment_1900:0 "Almirante Grau Class"
 PRU_CL_equipment_1900_desc:0 "The Almirante Grau-class consisted of two pre-WWI light cruisers built in Britain for the Peruvian Navy and commissioned in 1907. Even for a light cruiser, the ships were fairly small, displacing only 3,100 tons, and had below-average speed as well. They were lightly armored and had twin 152mm/50 caliber Vickers guns as their main armament."
 ### RAJ - BRITISH RAJ ###
 RAJ_SS_equipment_1912:0 "L Class"
 RAJ_SS_equipment_1912_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine-classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 RAJ_SS_equipment_1916:0 "T Class"
 RAJ_SS_equipment_1916_desc:0 "The T-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R-class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 RAJ_SS_equipment_1922:0 "U Class"
 RAJ_SS_equipment_1922_desc:0 "The U-class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the-class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 RAJ_SS_equipment_1933:0 "V Class"
 RAJ_SS_equipment_1933_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 RAJ_DD_equipment_1900:0 "V/W Class"
 RAJ_DD_equipment_1900_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W-classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 RAJ_DD_equipment_1912:0 "G/H/I Class"
 RAJ_DD_equipment_1912_desc:0 "The G, H, and I-class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F-class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H-classes were the same as in the F-class, with both using on the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 RAJ_DD_equipment_1916:0 "J/K/N Class"
 RAJ_DD_equipment_1916_desc:0 "The J, K, and N-classes were similar to the earlier Tribal-class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 RAJ_DD_equipment_1922:0 "Battle Class"
 RAJ_DD_equipment_1922_desc:0 "The Battle-class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war. The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 RAJ_CL_equipment_1900:0 "C Class"
 RAJ_CL_equipment_1900_desc:0 "C-class light cruisers were a group of twenty-eight light cruisers of the Royal Navy. They were built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions. Only the Caledon, Ceres, and Carlisle subclasses were in service by the mid 1930's."
 RAJ_basic_light_cruiser:0 "Southampton Class"
 RAJ_CL_equipment_1912:0 "Southampton Class"
 RAJ_CL_equipment_1912_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 RAJ_CL_equipment_1922:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 RAJ_CL_equipment_1922_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town-class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range was somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 RAJ_CL_equipment_1933:0 "Minotaur Class"
 RAJ_CL_equipment_1933_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure-class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony-class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony-class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 RAJ_CA_equipment_1895:0 "Hawkins Class"
 RAJ_CA_equipment_1895_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 RAJ_CA_equipment_1906:0 "Surrey Class"
 RAJ_CA_equipment_1906_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they would have been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 RAJ_CA_equipment_1922:0 "Admiral Class"
 RAJ_CA_equipment_1922_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 RAJ_CA_equipment_1933:0 "Churchill Design"
 RAJ_CA_equipment_1933_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland-class big gun cruisers. These vessels would have had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 RAJ_BC_equipment_1912:0 "Renown Class"
 RAJ_BC_equipment_1912_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 RAJ_BC_equipment_1916:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 RAJ_BC_equipment_1916_desc:0 "The Princess Royal was a-class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."

They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."

 SAF_DD_equipment_1922_desc:0 "The Battle-class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 SAF_CL_equipment_1900:0 "C Class"
 SAF_CL_equipment_1900_desc:0 "C-class light cruisers were a group of twenty-eight light cruisers of the Royal Navy. They were built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions. Only the Caledon, Ceres, and Carlisle subclasses were in service by the mid 1930's."
 SAF_CL_equipment_1912:0 "Southampton Class"
 SAF_CL_equipment_1912_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers.

 VIC_BC_equipment_1916:0 "Dunkerque Class"
 VIC_BC_equipment_1916_desc:0 "The Dunkerques were designed to counter the German Deutschland-class pocket battleships. They were the apex of a series design studies from the mid 1920's to early 1930's. Authorized in the 1931 and 1934 naval programs, they were similar to the British Nelson-class battleships, with all of their main turrets concentrated forward. This resulted in a shorter belt armor and thus a smaller ship to fit into the Naval Treaties limitations."

 VIC_CV_equipment_1930_desc:0 "The Béarn was originally laid down as a Normandie-class battleship but later finished as an aircraft carrier, displacing 22,100 tons and serving during the interbellum years and WWII. As a converted carrier, its speed was slow and it had limited space for aircraft, but the medium armor belt and long range made up for these shortcomings. Its construction gave important experience to the French designers in the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) and led to a series of design studies afterward."
 VIC_CV_equipment_1933:0 "Joffre Class"
 VIC_CV_equipment_1933_desc:0 "The Joffre-class carriers (Project name PA-16) were the next generation of carriers for the French Navy. It was the last of the design studies that started in 1929 and ended in 1937. Two ships were authorized in the 1938 naval program, but the escalating conflicts slowed down the construction process and eventually the Fall of France prevented the completion of these ships. Displacement would be around 20,000 tons. They would have good AA armament, armor, and speed, but a below-average aircraft complement. Overall, it would have been a well-rounded and versatile carrier for the French Navy."
 VIC_CV_equipment_1936:0 "Jean Bart Class"
 VIC_CV_equipment_1936_desc:0 "The Jean Bart carrier was a mid-war proposal to convert the unfinished Richelieu-class battleship Jean Bart into a full scale carrier in a similar way to the Japanese IJN Shinano. The hull's large size would be resulted in a large aircraft component and together with the big engines a long range and fast carrier. The heavy AA armament of US origin would have provided a good defense against aircraft and smaller surface combatants."
 VIC_CV_equipment_1940:0 "Clemenceau Class"
 VIC_CV_equipment_1940_desc:0 "The Clemenceau-class aircraft carrier (Project name PA-28) were the first postwar carrier design of the French Navy. The design would be similar to the unfinished Joffre-class carriers, though the installed equipment and weaponry would be of modern French products. The acquisition of the USN and RN escort carriers and the economical state of postwar France prevented these ships from being laid down. Not to be confused with the latter Clemenceau-class aircraft carriers (Project name PA-54), which were laid down in 1955 and 1957."
