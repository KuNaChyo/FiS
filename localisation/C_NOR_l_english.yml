 DH_norway.1.t:0 "Quisling's setting up a coup!"
 DH_norway.1.d:0 "Quisling thinks he now runs the place! He demands that the king appoints him the new Prime Minister, making him the most powerful man in Norway. This not only goes against against our constitution, it also means we are collaborating with the enemy. Yet, some dissenting voices utter that submitting is the only way to retain some of our influence, for otherwise the government will be abolished in its entirety."
 DH_norway.1.a:0 "Submit to the coup."
 DH_norway.1.b:0 "Who does he think he is!?"
